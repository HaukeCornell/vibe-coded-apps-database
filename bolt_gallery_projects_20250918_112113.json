      "description": "What problem does it solve, or what inspired you to build it? I built Creldesk because freelancers often waste time jumping between multiple tools for editing, creating proposals, building resumes, managing invoices, and handling small productivity tasks. Instead of opening five different websites, I wanted to create an all-in-one workdesk that puts everything in one place. The inspiration came from the everyday struggles of freelancers who need speed, organization, and reliability to get client work done efficiently.  Who is it for? Creldesk is designed for freelancers, remote workers, and students who need a clean, professional, and centralized dashboard for their daily tasks. Whether someone is editing visuals, writing proposals, or managing documents, Creldesk provides the essential tools in one platform.  Key Features & Functionality  Editors: Embedded Photopea editor, functional Logo Editor (with export options), Resume Builder (PDF export, AI-generated sections), Proposal Generator, and Invoice Generator.  Productivity Tools: PDF Compressor, Screen Recorder, File Converter (images and documents), and Audio Visualizer.  Utilities: QR Code Generator, Password Generator, Color Picker, and Pomodoro Timer.  Design & Usability:  Professional Apple-style dark mode UI with turquoise accents  Collapsible sidebar with categories (Editors, Productivity, Tools)  Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile  Fully functional tools (no placeholders)  Integrations: Uses iframes for embedded apps like Photopea, and custom-coded JavaScript/Tailwind for built-in tools such as the resume builder, logo editor, and file utilities.",

It detects deepfakes, physical spoofing (e.g. masks, fake limbs), and liveness failures using a combination of computer vision models and heuristic logic.  What makes IDMind unique is its ability to turn raw detection outputs into human-readable fraud reports using an integrated Large Language Model (LLM). This means compliance teams get clear, explainable reasons behind a “pass” or “flag” decision — not just raw scores.  It’s built for fintechs, crypto platforms, banks, and any digital platform that requires video-based user onboarding.",

My mom was a childcare assistant, and I had the chance to see dozens of little budding artists with their drawings, stories, and dreams. But these treasures often faded away over time. One day, I wondered: \"What if I could bring these childhood memories to life?\" Doodibook was born from this deep desire to capture children’s imagination, showcase their creations, and offer them an eternal keepsake to share.  What it does Doodibook is a magical web application that transforms children’s drawings into enchanting stories and illustrations. Users can create:  The Magic Book: a personalized book, chapter by chapter, enriched with automatically generated illustrations.  The Magic Card: a shorter format, a card with a magical drawing on the front and a tender story on the back.  The Lenticular Card: a card that changes image depending on the viewing angle, revealing magic before your eyes.  At the heart of this adventure, Owly, a mischievous and kind owl, guides children and brings their stories to life with magical feathers that users can acquire.",

      "description": "Hey! So I'm Lakshya, just turned 18 and still figuring out this whole \"adulting\" thing while finishing high school. Got obsessed with AI after falling down way too many YouTube rabbit holes (probably should've been studying lol). The Problem That Drove Me Crazy: I really wanted to start something with AI - like, I had all these ideas but every single tool I looked at was either $200+ per month or required me to basically become a programmer overnight. I'm decent with computers but come on, I'm not trying to spend 6 months learning Python just to build a simple chatbot. It felt like being the only person without a driver's license trying to get somewhere. What I Built: AutoBoss is basically what I wished existed when I started - a no-code way for regular people to create AI stuff and actually make money from it. Think of it as training wheels for starting an AI agency, but the training wheels actually work really well. Who It's For: Anyone who's curious about AI but doesn't want to become a developer. I'm thinking freelancers who want to add AI services, small business owners, people in their 20s-40s who are tech-curious but not tech-experts. Basically people like my mom who can use Canva but would run away screaming from GitHub. What It Actually Does:  Client Workspaces - keeps your projects organized instead of having 47 browser tabs open AI Employee Builder - you can make chatbots or data analysis tools (added some badges because why not make it fun?) Document Training - upload PDFs or paste website URLs to teach your AI stuff Easy Sharing - send clients their AI tools through simple links  I built it mostly with Bolt.new (which is amazing btw), Firebase for the backend stuff, and Next.js. Did most of the coding between 11pm-2am because that's when my brain actually works. The Cool Part: In June, I got some people to test it and they were building working AI solutions in like 10-15 minutes. One person made a chatbot for a local bakery that actually helped them res",

My apps might be a little weird (GlyphOS Task Manager, GlyphOS Falling Stars, and GlyphOS Clocks) but they all offer useful, integrated functionality that I already find myself using daily. Thanks to Bolt, I can make this ideas into a reality. So who is this app built for? Editors, freelancers, people who work remotely with multiple screens. Future plans are full mobile app with push notifications.",

      "description": "Awaken was born from one core frustration: self-help often feels boring, inconsistent, or overwhelming. Especially for young men who grew up on anime, games, and the internet. We wanted to build something better. A system that makes personal growth feel like leveling up your character, not checking off chores.  Most people already know what they should do. Go to the gym. Save money. Stay focused. But knowing isn’t the problem. The real struggle is staying consistent without structure, feedback, or a sense of momentum.  Awaken turns self-development into an RPG.  It gives each user daily AI-generated quests based on their goals across fitness, wealth, mindset, and relationships. Completing quests earns EXP, levels up their anime-style avatar, and drives real-world growth. Avatars are generated from selfies and evolve as the user does.  Core features include quest streaks, ranking systems, guilds, and optional social media locks for missed goals. Every detail is designed to feel like story-driven progress — not just productivity.  Who it’s for: Ambitious young adults who want more from life but are tired of generic advice. Especially men aged 16 to 33 who grew up immersed in anime, gaming, and online culture. They don’t want a boring checklist. They want a system that speaks their language.  Awaken is not just another app. It is an identity builder, a discipline engine, and a culture in the making. We are reimagining what it means to grow.",

      "description": "I wanted to explore whether a simple interactive experience could leave a lasting emotional impact. We’re constantly surrounded by statistics about war, climate change, and social issues, but they often feel distant or abstract. I wondered—what if we could sneak that awareness in through something unexpected?  Impact Taps looks like a game at first. You tap for 10 seconds, thinking it's about speed or reflexes. But when the timer ends, you’re shown your score as a real-world statistic—like the number of children killed in conflict zones last year, or the amount of plastic dumped into the ocean every day. The surprise makes people stop and think. That’s the goal.  This was built entirely using one prompt on Bolt.new. The app uses JavaScript to track taps, a 10-second timer, and a simple local JSON file filled with verified statistics. No backend, no fancy logic. Just a clean interface and one strong emotional reveal.  Impact Taps is for anyone who scrolls the web mindlessly and needs a moment of perspective. It’s quick, frictionless, and designed to catch people off guard—in a good way.",

It's like whack-a-mole, but the targets move around wildly, get smaller, and get faster the more you hit them. You can pick emojis, words, or images as your target — and it all runs right in your browser, no sign-ups or installs needed.",

      "description": "Managing daily tasks can feel like a chore especially when switching between tools or typing things out manually. As a freelancer, I often juggle multiple clients and projects, and I’ve personally struggled with time management, scheduling, sending updates on time, and just keeping track of what needs to be done.  I wanted to build something that lets people offload that mental load using simple voice or chat interaction. That's where TaskVoice AI was born a smart productivity assistant that lets you create tasks using AI chat, AI voice, or manual input, however you prefer to work.  I was inspired by the way people talk to assistants like Siri or ChatGPT, but I wanted to give that power a focused purpose: getting things done fast and frictionlessly.  TaskVoice AI is a smart productivity assistant that helps users create and manage tasks using three input modes:  Voice AI — Speak your tasks naturally, and it understands and schedules them.  Chat AI — Type your task in plain English; the AI handles the rest.  Manual input — Quickly add or customize tasks with full control.  Tasks are automatically categorized into Today, Tomorrow, or Upcoming based on natural language. It's fast, flexible, and works the way you think — by voice, chat, or tap.",

      "description": "Mamabase is an emotionally intelligent AI companion designed to support parents through everyday parenting challenges. Inspired by my own experience raising two young kids, I noticed that stories helped my older child process big emotions better than lectures — but finding the right story in the moment wasn’t always easy.  Mamabase solves this by taking a real-life parenting situation (like sibling jealousy or tantrums) and generating a personalized, age-appropriate story — complete with a teaching moment and a printable illustration — to help children understand and cope.  Built for busy parents, Mamabase features:  A warm AI agent that reflects back emotional insight  A customizable “StoryCoach” experience with user-selected style and tone  Integration with OpenAI (via Bolt) and Supabase (auth & storage)  Example prompt from the user: “My 4-year-old melts down when it’s time to leave the park.”  Mamabase replies with emotional reflection, parenting support, and a unique story to share with the child — all in under a minute.",

I built it because I lived the problem. On my first day as a PM intern, I was handed a product with no documentation, no onboarding, and no real support. Three years and many mentorship conversations later, I realized this is still the norm — especially in fast-paced startups.  Ramp brings structure to those chaotic first weeks. It gives you:  A tailored 3-week onboarding checklist  A real-world “Ask a PM” AI assistant  A library of ready-to-use templates  I built Ramp in a single AI prompt using Bolt, styled with TailwindCSS and powered by GPT-4o logic (coming). It’s fully responsive, requires no login, and is designed for real-world PM struggles — the kind no one prepares you for.  If it helps even one PM feel less lost in their first 90 days, it’s done its job.",

While the world faced crisis after crisis—from the unrest in Manipur to global tragedies—there was no platform that truly captured the emotional state of the world. News overwhelmed us but never asked: how does the world feel right now?  We built Symbione for those who want more than just headlines, for those who want to feel the news, not just read it.  What makes it special?  Symbione maps global news into a 3D emotional space using AI, sentiment analysis, and data from platforms like Reddit, grouped by emotions like joy, fear, anger, and hope. It’s not just a feed; it’s a visual, emotional landscape. Users can explore stories, save them to the Cosmark (an AI-powered research space), and interact with an emotional assistant for deeper understanding.  Symbione is for the emotionally curious, the thinkers, the feelers, the ones seeking connection in a disconnected world.",

We started with a huge prompt and a very detailed explanation of what we want. Roughly 95% of the things we requested were implemented correctly, which was insane to see. Afterwards we iterated a lot to get every detail right. We did always only do small incremental changes. This approach worked best for us. Overall bolt.new allowed us to skip the design face with Figma completely and use the bolt.new app directly in first end user tests. A fantastic experience overall!",

In many cities, users are forced to rely on separate apps for bikes, scooters, or cars—or commit to expensive long-term rentals. Wheely solves this by offering an all-in-one platform where users can rent bicycles, scooters, motorbikes, and cars on an hourly basis. Designed for tourists, students, gig workers, and daily commuters, it allows users to browse nearby vehicles, select rental duration, and return them at designated drop zones. The app is built using React Native with Expo Router for seamless navigation, Lucide Icons for a clean UI, and Django Rest Framework on the backend. Key features include dynamic ride selection, intuitive modals, multi-language support, and a responsive UI for both Android and iOS. We also designed the system to be scalable—ready for future integrations like GPS tracking, payments, referral programs, and even a unique Subletting feature where users can share unused rental time with others. With Wheely, we’re redefining short-term transportation as smarter, more flexible, and community-driven.",

      "description": "💡What problem does it solve, or what inspired you to build it? Who is it for?  PurpleVerse was inspired by the frustrating limitations people in low-income countries face when shopping online — especially when it comes to international payments, FOREX instability, and platform restrictions. Traditional e-commerce is often inaccessible or expensive for users in these regions, and that creates a digital divide in global trade.  I wanted to solve this by creating a borderless e-commerce platform that leverages crypto (USDC on Algorand Testnet for the prototype) as the means of payment. This removes the need for traditional financial systems and enables secure, trustless transactions worldwide — even for physical goods.  PurpleVerse is for:  Buyers who want to shop globally without payment restrictions.  Sellers looking to reach wider markets and access intelligent tools.  Emerging markets underserved by mainstream payment systems.   🔑 Key Features & Functionality  Crypto-Powered Payments Secure, escrow-based crypto transactions using USDC on Algorand. Funds are held until buyers confirm delivery.  Mock Wallet Integration For demo purposes, a hardcoded mock wallet simulates crypto payments and release flows.  AI-Assisted Seller Tools Sellers get help writing product descriptions, tracking analytics, and managing inventory through AI-powered features.  Admin Dashboard Full control panel to manage users, roles, featured products, commissions, and blog content.  Flash Sales & Featured Listings Sellers can run time-limited offers or pay to boost product visibility across the platform.  Platform Revenue Model 5% commission on every sale + featured product placement fees, all automated.  Blog and AI Chatbot (Support) Includes a built-in blog CMS and AI chatbot to assist buyers and sellers with FAQs and navigation.   🔌 Built With:  Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vite  Backend: Supabase (auth, DB, storage, functions, RLS)  Blockchain: Algorand (Testnet) using algo",

Interviews with adult SCD patients from the U.S., Kenya, and Trinidad & Tobago revealed urgent unmet needs: lack of 24/7 advocacy, poor access to medication, no emergency support system, and a deep desire for peer connection. The SATA app is built to change that. Core features include: Peer Network & Emergency Volunteer Help via geo-tagged maps and a \"Connect to Warrior/Volunteer\" button to summon real-time help to advocate for patients during ER visits or hospitalizations Trusted Facility Ratings (CareScore) based on lived experience, not just clinical data Medication & Appointment Tracker to help patients manage long-term care Pain Distraction Tools to reduce mental health burden during hospital stays",

Just structure, reflection, and support—so you can keep showing up, even on the tough days.

      "description": "I’ve always wanted to master proper touch typing—but no existing app truly satisfied me.  Typing games that focused on speed were fun, but didn’t help develop correct finger positioning. On the other hand, apps that focused on form and accuracy were mind-numbingly boring and hard to stick with.  I kept asking myself: \"Why isn't there a typing app that's both fun and technically effective?\" That question became the spark for TYPE INVADER.  What if the only way to save Earth from destruction was to type... perfectly?",

      "description": "I grew up in a home full of children where creativity flourished. My mom was a childcare assistant, and I had the chance to see dozens of little budding artists with their drawings, stories, and dreams. But these treasures often faded away over time. One day, I wondered: \"What if I could bring these childhood memories to life?\" Doodibook was born from this deep desire to capture children’s imagination, showcase their creations, and offer them an eternal keepsake to share.  What it does Doodibook is a magical web application that transforms children’s drawings into enchanting stories and illustrations. Users can create:  The Magic Book: a personalized book, chapter by chapter, enriched with automatically generated illustrations.  The Magic Card: a shorter format, a card with a magical drawing on the front and a tender story on the back.  The Lenticular Card: a card that changes image depending on the viewing angle, revealing magic before your eyes.  At the heart of this adventure, Owly, a mischievous and kind owl, guides children and brings their stories to life with magical feathers that users can acquire.",

It's built for detail-oriented, independent travelers who value their time and experience.  Our app is a weather-aware itinerary builder. Unlike static tools, it fetches real-time and historical weather forecasts before you plan your day. This allows you to intelligently schedule activities, placing outdoor adventures on sunny days and museum visits on rainy ones.  Key features include:  Deep Personalization: We go beyond basic planning, allowing users to filter activities by their budget, preferred activity category (like culture, dining, or adventure), and even by group size (e.g., finding activities that require more than one person).  Real, Enriched Data: We use the OpenTripMap API and enrich its data with our own logic to provide these smart filters.  Privacy-First: It's 100% registration-free, with all data stored locally.  Modern Stack: Built with Vite, React, and TypeScript, and deployed on Netlify.",

While visiting my hometown in Albania to spend time with my family and work remotely, I decided one evening to take a solo walk along the city boulevard. That’s when I came across a small stand with three adorable puppies and a sign about Wet Noses Saranda, an initiative started by a local woman named Kristi to rescue and rehome stray dogs.  As a dog lover, I immediately felt a connection. After reading about their work, I knew I wanted to help. As a software engineer, I offered to build them a website even though I had limited free time.",

      "description": "As a neurotypical person, I’ve watched friends and coworkers with ADHD navigate a world that wasn’t built for their communication style, seeing the constant friction and immense mental effort it took to process a simple wall of text. The burden was always on them to adapt, and that didn’t sit right with me. I wanted to flip that script and build a bridge, which is why I created BRYGE AI. It’s an AI-powered communication assistant for any neurotypical person—a manager, a friend, or a partner—who wants to connect more thoughtfully and effectively with the ADHD minds in their life. It goes far beyond grammar checkers to fundamentally reshape how a message is crafted and emotionally received. First, it acts as a personal coach, intelligently analyzing your original message for hidden pressure words and emotional triggers. Then, it transforms dense text into clean, emotionally safer language that you can customize with different tones and intents. Its standout feature, powered by ElevenLabs, is the ability to generate a personalized voice note in your own voice, which lowers the cognitive load for the recipient and eliminates the cold, robotic feel of other AI tools. Ultimately, BRYGE AI doesn’t just fix one message—it teaches you how to communicate better, helping you build the lasting habits of clarity, kindness, and emotional intelligence that reshape all your relationships.",

It was sparked by a single, chilling question: What happens when you can no longer trust the information you receive—or receive no information at all?  This functional prototype, built for the Bolt.new Hackathon, transforms any smartphone into a node in a peer-powered safety network. It's built for communities, enabling them to send, receive, and verify critical alerts without relying on central servers.  Key Features: - A full-stack application with a live Supabase backend for real-time alerts. - A multi-page dashboard for threat monitoring and reporting. - A community-based verification system to combat misinformation. - A \"Trusted Circle\" interface for personal network management.  The entire project, from concept and UI design to the full-stack integration, was built in under 72 hours through an intensive human-AI collaboration using Bolt.new, Gemini, and other AI tools.",

Cities are filled with incredible street art that often goes unnoticed, while tourists and locals alike struggle to discover authentic cultural experiences beyond typical attractions. Traditional tours are expensive and inflexible, operating on rigid schedules that don't accommodate spontaneous exploration. Our solution is an SMS-based scavenger hunt that guides users through urban street art discoveries. The platform uses Twilio for text messaging interactions and Supabase for secure authentication. Users explore cities through graffiti pieces and locations stored in our database, unlocking new experiences at their own pace. We're building organic reach through automatically generated blog content based on our cataloged street art and partnerships. Our partnership pages are already ranking well in Google searches, creating a sustainable growth channel. The platform is fully monetized with Stripe integration for seamless payments. The concept was inspired by a personal experience exploring historic buildings in London, but evolved to focus specifically on street art to create a more vibrant, contemporary urban adventure.",

      "description": "The Nokia 3310 from the early 2000s was my first taste of mobile gaming. I spent dozens of hours playing Snake on my father’s phone. I wanted to recreate that feeling in a single prompt for the Oneshot Challenge. Building the basic Snake game was the easy part, the real challenge was designing the layout and pixel font to match the retro style, all within a single prompt and without needing follow-ups. I’d like to add that, although I work as a project manager, I have very limited hands-on experience with programming and Bolt honestly feels like magic.  I'll gladly share the prompt via DM on X (https://x.com/kolar_eth)  What it does Recreates Snake on an 84 × 48 grid of 8 px divs Arrow keys/WASD + space-to-start Authentic LCD “jitter” (0.5 px gaps) Retro beeps (Web Audio API) Score rendered in a 5 × 5 pixel font outside the grid How I built it React + TypeScript inside Bolt.new Tailwind CSS grid utilities only—no <canvas> Game loop via setInterval, food blink via requestAnimationFrame Modular components: GameGrid.tsx, ScoreDisplay.tsx, Overlay.tsx Challenges Keeping pixel gaps intact after CSS transforms Syncing score font with un-scaled grid pixels Accomplishments Zero images/SVG—100 % div-driven graphics",

      "description": "“Introducción al 1/4 de milla argentino” es un e-book pensado para cubrir la falta de material especializado en español y adaptado al contexto local sobre esta disciplina del automovilismo.  Problema que resuelve / Inspiración En Argentina existen muy pocos recursos accesibles para quienes quieren iniciarse en el mundo del cuarto de milla: la información está dispersa en foros, videos y manuales en inglés, sin un recorrido pedagógico que guíe paso a paso a principiantes. Me inspiró mi propia experiencia como corredor aficionado y la pasión de la comunidad local, para condensar todo en un sólo manual claro y práctico.  Público objetivo – Aficionados y entusiastas del drag racing que recién comienzan. – Pilotos de calle y clubes de automóviles que quieran profesionalizar su preparación. – Talleres y preparadores que busquen una guía básica de referencia.  Características clave  Historia y contexto local: evolución del cuarto de milla en pistas argentinas, anécdotas y referencias a eventos destacados.  Guías prácticas: desde la elección del vehículo y sus componentes (suspensión, neumáticos, transmisión) hasta ajustes básicos de motor e inyección.  Electrónica aplicada: conceptos de mapas de ECU, uso de sensores (TPS, RPM, temperatura), y ejemplos de configuración semisecuencial.  Técnicas de conducción: staging, launch control, manejo de la tracción y los cambios para optimizar el crono.  Seguridad y normativa: checklist de equipamiento obligatorio, permisos y reglamentos de pista.  Recursos adicionales: plantillas de registro de tiempos, códigos QR a tutoriales en video y enlaces a proveedores argentinos.",

After spending 45-minute grocery runs Googling obscure additives for my daughter’s allergies—and my own post-mold-toxicity diet—I built an app that vet ingredients in a single tap.  Problem it solves Decoding food labels is tedious, inconsistent, and risky for anyone with allergies or dietary restrictions. CleanScan automates that legwork, instantly flagging problem ingredients and suggesting healthier substitutes.  Who it’s for • Parents managing kids’ food allergies • “Clean-eating” shoppers avoiding seed oils, dyes, etc. • Fitness or medical professionals who need quick label audits  Key features & integrations \t•\tLive OCR + Barcode Scan – Tesseract.js captures ingredient lists; fallback UPC lookup coming. \t•\tPersonalized Profiles – store allergies, dietary goals, and “avoid” lists. \t•\tCleanScore Engine – OpenAI o4-mini parses text, maps aliases (“rapeseed ≠ canola”), ranks product cleanliness, and flags synthetics. \t•\tCleaner Alternatives – AI suggests in-stock substitutes, one-tap add to a sharable shopping list. \t•\tPrivacy-First Analytics – Supabase auth and RLS keep scans private while anonymized ingredient hashes power trend dashboards. \t•\tNetlify + React/Vite PWA – installs like an app, works offline for repeated scans.  Prompt example: “Parse this ingredient list and return JSON: {ingredients[], flagged[], cleanScore, topAlternatives[]}”",

That reality inspired me to build MindBloom—a mobile app that empowers individuals to take ownership of their mental health in a safe, accessible, and gamified way.  I wanted to create something that felt like self-care, not therapy—a tool that encourages consistency through beauty, play, and AI-driven support. MindBloom is more than a hackathon project; it’s a statement that mental health matters, no matter where you live or what resources you have.",

Inspired by my own 2020 battle with mold toxicity, the app unifies everything a user needs in one dashboard: \t•\tSmart Assessment – a quick intake scores exposure history and current symptoms, seeding an AI-tailored recovery protocol (binders, diet tweaks, lifestyle habits). \t•\tDynamic Daily Checklist – completion rings and reminders keep users consistent. \t•\tSymptom Tracker – preset sliders + free-text inputs log severity and automatically chart progress. \t•\tAI Insights – nightly OpenAI o4-mini jobs (via Supabase Edge cron) analyze trends and suggest protocol tweaks (“increase charcoal binder dose,” “add sauna sessions”). \t•\tEvidence Library – curated papers, recipes, and doctor-approved videos appear contextually as users log issues. \t•\tOne-click Physician PDF – serverless Puppeteer generates a compressed report users can email to their practitioner.  Built with React/Vite, Supabase (auth, row-level security, storage), Recharts/Tailwind for visuals, and Netlify for zero-ops deployment, MoldMend turns a confusing, multi-month healing journey into clear, data-driven steps—helping sufferers breathe easier, regain energy, and reclaim their lives.",

Bag Manager makes it easy to build, simulate, and refine your bag online. Create your current setup, test alternate bags, swap discs in and out, and quickly spot gaps in your coverage. Planning for wind? A forehand-only challenge? Just want to play around? Clone and compare bags in seconds.  It’s a fun, flexible, and visual way to get more intentional with your plastic—without ever stepping onto the course.",

      "description": "LifeBeacon revolutionizes emergency rescue by transforming smartphones into life-saving beacons for trapped victims during disasters. The Problem: In 2024, 10,000+ people died under rubble after earthquakes and building collapses. Current rescue methods using dogs, thermal cameras, or manual searching are often too slow during the critical first 48 hours when every minute counts. The Solution: A dual-app emergency system creating direct communication between trapped victims and rescue teams. Nearly everyone carries a powerful beacon - their smartphone. LifeBeacon unlocks this potential to dramatically reduce search time. LifeBeacon Civil (for civilians - https://serene-kelpie-605da4.netlify.app/):  Automatic emergency signals when app installed Large stress-resistant SOS button for conscious victims Receives wake commands from rescue teams Optimized battery management for extended operation under debris Discreet mode for dangerous situations  LifeBeacon Rescue (complementary app for emergency responders):  Real-time radar detection of civilian signals Advanced filtering by priority, battery level, and distance Remote wake commands to trigger sounds/vibrations on victim phones Team coordination and mission management  Key Innovation: Creates a direct communication bridge between trapped victims and rescue teams, potentially saving thousands of lives through technology everyone already carries. Built with Bolt.new by a first-time developer in 3 days, proving that determination and AI-powered development can create life-saving solutions.",

      "description": "Inspiration As students, we often find ourselves distracted while studying — especially when switching between our e-materials, YouTube, and AI tools. A simple task like understanding a concept quickly becomes a rabbit hole of distractions.  We wanted a solution that lets students upload their study material and stay locked in — learning, asking AI questions, and watching only the right videos — all in one focused space. That’s how SuperArc was born:  An AI-powered, distraction-free study platform that helps students focus deeply and build their comeback arc.  What it does SuperArc is a productivity-first platform designed for students and self-learners. It lets users:  Upload PDFs, notes, or any study materials Use AI to ask questions contextually based on their material Get YouTube video suggestions relevant to the topic they're reading Summarize long content instantly Auto-generate flashcards after each topic Study in Pomodoro mode with streak tracking and gamified progress Unlock badges like \"Ignition\" and \"Locked In\" based on study discipline All of this happens within a dark-mode, focused workspace — built to help users stay in the zone.  How we built it We designed and built the UI with:  React.js for the front end ShadCN for clean, modern UI components Supabase for authentication and file storage Gemini API for contextual AI chat, summaries, and topic detection YouTube Data API for fetching educational videos based on extracted content We also built modular sections:  A reading pane for uploaded materials AI assistant chat Flashcard tab Video suggestion tab A focus timer with built-in badge reward logic Challenges we ran into Accurately extracting readable text from PDF documents in various formats Making AI responses strictly context-aware (based on the uploaded material only) Suggesting YouTube videos that are actually relevant and educational — not just clickbait Designing the experience to feel motivational but not overwhelming Accomplishments that we're",

It solves the growing problem of AI-generated content misuse by giving each piece of content a unique, tamper-proof authenticity record.

      "description": "As someone who works full-time and loves staying up to date with AI research, I found it nearly impossible to keep up with all the new papers coming out. Most papers are dense, and YouTube explainers are long and time-consuming. I wanted something that would let me learn while doing other things—whether I'm walking, commuting, or at the gym.  That’s what inspired me to build AI Snax. It’s designed for busy professionals, curious learners, students, and even AI enthusiasts who want to stay sharp without having to carve out focused reading time. The app delivers short, 2–3 minute audio podcasts that break down recent AI papers into digestible bites.  Users can scroll through podcast cards, listen on the go, save favorites, and even view the original paper on arXiv if they want to dive deeper. On the backend, I integrated ElevenLabs to generate high-quality voice narration, Supabase for authentication and user profiles, and Netlify for seamless deployment. Admin users can upload transcripts or trigger podcast generation with just a few clicks.  It’s a simple idea, but the impact is real—turn passive time into learning time, without adding more to your to-do list.",

      "description": "In 2020, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, I saw how many people silently struggled — needing help but unable or afraid to ask for it. Meanwhile, others wanted to help but had no idea who needed support or where to go.  That’s when the idea for Open Letter Map was born — a way to put help requests on a map so responders could act fast. In 2025, I brought this vision to life and reimagined it as Open World Map – Call for Heroes for the Bolt.new hackathon. Open World Map is a real-time, location-based social platform where:      Civilians can issue help requests or report local issues.     Heroes (volunteers or skilled individuals) can respond based on their abilities and proximity.     Organizations can coordinate support at scale.  Core features:      Drop issue markers on the map     Request or offer help with optional visibility     Like, comment, and chat on issues and updates     Post statuses and mission logs like a social feed     View hero profiles with skills, missions, and reputation",

Most language learning tools focus on isolated vocabulary and grammar, but learners often struggle when it’s time to speak or listen. Polylogue solves this by delivering contextualized, level-appropriate stories and animations, supported by images, gestures, and native audio — just like how we naturally acquire language.  Inspired by both research in language acquisition and the lack of quality content for many underserved languages, Polylogue is built for learners of all levels, and especially for those passionate about preserving and using less-resourced languages.  Key features:  Visual stories narrated by native speakers  Multi-language subtitles and translations  Community contributions of recordings and content  Support for all languages, including endangered ones  Built using Supabase, React, and FFmpeg for voice synthesis and content moderation  Polylogue is currently in beta — we’re focused on refining the experience and growing the content through user contributions.",

      "description": "Recruitment in Bangladesh is so flawed that the students of my country had to overthrow the government in an attempt to reform it.  Entry-level jobs ask for 2-3 years of “work experience”, have sky-high credential requirements (which are often unrelated to the job) and the interview process often lasts for months on end. Moreover, recruiters often favor those from more prestigious Universities or those with referrals.  Employers are always complaining about “not finding talent with the right practical skills” but skilled job seekers in Bangladesh are often overlooked due to the above reasons.  LaunchPad connects employers to skilled talent and skilled talent to opportunities that they have long been deprived of.  Here’s how:  Employers post the job description and a short task that is related to the job, such as making a to-do app for an app development job. Instead of just putting in a resume, the candidate has to finish the task and upload it along with their skill portfolio.  This way, employers can directly evaluate the candidate’s practical skills without any bias. Additionally, this ensures only those with the relevant skills can apply, which means candidates don’t get their application buried by thousands of irrelevant people spamming their resumes on every job. Another problem is that many graduates don’t even know what practical skills they would need for their dream job. To solve this, we used ChatGPT-3.5-turbo API integration to analyse the user’s skill level and job target to build a custom roadmap with skill-building challenges to help them build up their skills & portfolio. We’re not just a job posting site, we’re the leaders of a movement to make hiring fair for all.",

That spark of personal frustration and heartfelt nostalgia led me to build LullaRead.",

In Honor Of was built to solve a simple but powerful problem: most veterans' stories live only in memory, not online. Families often have photos, dates, and medals — but nowhere to bring it all together in a respectful, lasting way.  This app is for families, friends, and loved ones of U.S. veterans — as well as community groups and organizations that want to celebrate those who served. It’s designed to be welcoming and easy to use, even for people with little technical experience.  Key features include:  A guided form to create a personalized tribute  Dedicated tribute pages styled by military branch (Army, Navy, etc.)  Ability to upload photos, write a message, and list medals or achievements  A public Wall of Honor to browse and celebrate all shared tributes  Option to feature a tribute with a donation  Built with Supabase (database, auth) and Netlify (hosting) for speed and scalability",

      "description": "A woman’s monthly cycle has phases that affect her mood, energy, and stress levels. CycleWise gives husbands gentle alerts and simple guidance on when and how to show the support that truly matters. I have observed how the understanding, or misunderstanding, of emotions between spouses can make or break the peace in a home. In many cases, I saw how domestic tension, even violence against women, often stemmed from emotional misinterpretation.  This got me asking the question: \"What if men knew more about the emotions of their wives?\" I began researching how much men knew about the emotional cycles of women. I interviewed some married men and asked the question \"Are you aware that your wife’s monthly cycle influences her emotions and behavior?\" Over 98% had no idea. They were often shocked and remorseful. A common reaction was: “If I had known this earlier, I would have been more patient and supportive.”  This became my initial inspiration to build an app that gives husbands the insight to understand and support the emotional health of their wives. The next inspiration was their willingness to pay a token for monthly subscription (one responder promised to donate to the product), and the final inspiration is that the tools to easily build it was made available by Bolt's hackathon. What it does  CycleWise gives husbands the insight to understand and support the emotional health of their wives. It uses the cycle start date to calculate the emotionally sensitive phase, and sends monthly alert and support tips, a day before it starts. I believe it can improve marriage relationships and help to build more peaceful homes. How we built it  I interviewed 8 married men in an effort to validate the idea, and got them on the wait-list. Bolt.New was used to build all core functionalities till it was production-ready with: Payment processing (Paystack for Nigeria, Stripe for international) Supabase integration with payment status tracking Beautiful, responsive design Email collect",

From drag-and-drop lineups to automatic substitution schedules and real-time playtime tracking, it simplifies match-day management. Stay focused on the game—doHockey handles the logistics.  ##Why doHockey? As an amateur field hockey coach, I know how much time and effort goes into managing a team — especially on busy weekends. Planning lineups, tracking playtime, and organizing substitutions often takes more time than the match itself. That’s why I developed doHockey: a practical, time-saving tool designed to take the hassle out of match-day management.  doHockey helps coaches stay focused on the game by handling the logistics. You can easily create lineups with a drag-and-drop interface, automatically generate substitution schedules based on preset intervals, and track each player’s playtime in real time. Whether you want to rotate players every 6 or 9 minutes, or ensure fair playing time for everyone, doHockey makes it simple.  The tool supports standard match settings — four quarters of 17.5 minutes, with up to five reserves — and provides a live dashboard during the match, along with a printable substitution schedule to keep things running smoothly on the sidelines.  doHockey is built for coaches like me, who love the sport but could use a bit of help staying organized. It saves time, reduces stress, and ensures every player gets the attention they deserve.  Inspiration  As an amateur field hockey coach, I often spend more time planning than coaching. Organizing lineups, substitutions, and tracking playtime — especially during weekend matches — can be stressful and inefficient. I wanted a tool to take care of the logistics so I could focus on the team and the game.",

      "description": "This project, \"HealthCostBenefit - Evidence-Based Supplement Analysis,\" is designed to help individuals make informed decisions about dietary supplements by providing a data-driven approach to evaluating their cost-effectiveness.  The core problem it solves is the lack of clear, evidence-based information regarding the true value and return on investment (ROI) of various supplements. Many consumers purchase supplements without understanding their potential health benefits in quantifiable terms or their economic impact. This platform aims to bridge that gap by applying principles of health economics, specifically Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), to supplement analysis.  It is primarily for health-conscious individuals, researchers, and anyone looking to understand the scientific and economic rationale behind supplement use.  Key features and functionality include:  AI-Powered Database Expansion: The application leverages AI to automatically research, validate, and populate a comprehensive database of supplements. This involves integrating with external APIs like PubMed for scientific literature, RapidAPI for real-time pricing data, and OpenAI for synthesizing complex information into understandable supplement profiles. It also includes robust validation and cleanup mechanisms to ensure data quality. Quantifiable Health Benefits: It translates the health outcomes associated with supplements into QALY gains, providing a standardized measure of health improvement. Cost-Benefit Analysis: Users can see the calculated ROI for supplements, comparing their monthly cost against their estimated health benefit value. Interactive Visualizations: The platform presents complex data through intuitive charts and comparison tables, allowing users to easily compare different supplements side-by-side. Reporting and Export: Users can generate and export detailed PDF reports or print-friendly versions of their analyses. Supabase Integration: All supplement data is persistently stored",

      "description": "NutureAI is an AI-powered, culturally-intelligent health companion. It aims to provide health guidance that understands and respects an individual's cultural background, food traditions, and lifestyle preferences.  The problem NutureAI solves is the inadequacy of generic health advice and technology for diverse populations. Many existing health applications recommend approaches that don't align with the cultural practices or traditional healing foods of various communities. This leads to a disconnect where health technology fails to serve the full spectrum of how people live, eat, and find joy in movement.  NutureAI's solution is to offer personalized coaching that learns an individual's life, not just their data, by considering their schedule, preferences, family dynamics, and cultural context. It also fosters community connection, creating a \"cultural health village\" where users can connect with others who share their background and health journey. The core mission is to ensure that every person receives health guidance that celebrates their culture, rather than erasing it. NutureAI offers three key benefits:  Cultural Adaptation: It honors your food heritage by using AI that understands traditional foods, cooking methods, and cultural health practices from your background. Personalized Coaching: It learns your life, not just data, through adaptive coaching that considers your schedule, preferences, family dynamics, and cultural context. Community Connection: It provides a cultural health village where you can connect with others who share your cultural background and health journey for support and accountability.",

That was me—ruffling through CFP listings late into the night during my own paper submissions. I remember matching my abstract on adaptive signal processing to a niche workshop in Spain, frantically cross‐checking scope statements, and juggling a spreadsheet of deadlines. It felt like a part‐time job just to find the right venue. We realized how absurd it was that in 2024 we still had to manually sift through pages of CFP listings, cross‐check scopes, and pray we’d catch the submission window on time.",

      "description": "As someone navigating careers in both Cybersecurity and Web Development, I quickly realized just how frustrating it was to constantly tweak and tailor my resume for different roles. One week I’d be applying for a SOC analyst role, and the next, a web app developer position, and each time, I had to reformat, rewrite, and rephrase my CV from scratch.  I’d often find myself wondering:  Didn’t I already write a better version of this somewhere?  Which version did I use for that last successful interview?  How do I make sure my resume passes those annoying ATS systems?  It was overwhelming, not because I didn’t have the experience, but because I didn’t have a system.  That’s when it hit me: why not build the system myself?  CVStore was born out of this pain point. I wanted a tool that could:  Store my professional profile once.  Let AI handle the resume generation, whether for cybersecurity, development, or something new.  Keep track of every version I created so I could reuse or update them later.  Optimize each resume for real-world ATS systems, not just templates that “look nice.”  I didn’t just build it for myself, I built it for every multi-skilled professional, freelancer, or job-switcher who’s tired of redoing the same work over and over. CVStore is my way of turning my own challenge into a powerful, time-saving solution for others.",

I built it because nobody really talks about the environmental cost of AI and I wanted a way to track my usage without guilt-tripping myself.

It was inspired by the observation that traditional trackers can be discouraging, especially for children and individuals facing developmental or physical challenges. When a user misses a day, many apps highlight the failure, creating shame and making it hard to continue.  GlowMyState solves this problem by creating an emotionally safe space. Instead of rigid checkmarks, users interact with delightful, floating bubbles to log their progress or consciously skip a day without any penalty. This removes the pressure and makes trying again feel natural and rewarding.  Designed for inclusivity, GlowMyState is perfect for children, neurodiverse users, and any adult seeking a softer, more mindful approach to personal growth. Key features include:    Rich customization with over 10 colors and icons to express each day uniquely.  Separate Child & Parent Modes, secured by a PIN for safe and gentle supervision.  Optional memos for reflection, gratitude, or journaling.  A simple, touch-friendly interface with an animated onboarding flow that requires no complex tutorials.  An optional AI Report that offers gentle encouragement by focusing on positive trends.  Ultimately, GlowMyState empowers users to feel proud of their unique journey and find a tracking style that feels truly their own.",

It always felt random. Like a problem no one actually wanted to solve.  One day she turned to me and asked if AI could help. I work in tech, and she was curious about what I do. I ran a quick analysis, built her a routine, and she tried it. And it worked.  She said, “You have to make this into an app. People need this.”  That’s how SmartHair started. It wasn’t about building a business. It was about helping her. It still is.  What it does SmartHair gives you a routine that actually works. You take a photo. You answer one question. That’s it. The app reads your hair and gives you real guidance based on what you actually need.  It’s not about selling products. It’s not a funnel. It doesn’t ask for fifteen minutes of your time. It respects you.  This is for people who are tired of being talked down to. Who don’t want another trendy serum. Who just want to understand their hair and take care of it.",

      "description": "Small businesses and second-hand sellers often struggle to gain visibility online without paid ads, SEO expertise, or influencer reach. At the same time, nearby buyers don’t realize these sellers exist—even when they offer exactly what they need. NearCart solves this by creating a bridge between undiscovered sellers and local buyers, using real-time location intelligence. This project was inspired by the need to make local commerce truly discoverable—not through algorithms or marketing, but through simple proximity. It’s about turning communities into living marketplaces and giving solo sellers a fair shot at success. NearCart is built for small businesses and startups that struggle to get noticed online, second-hand or individual sellers who want to connect with nearby customers, consumers seeking instant access to local products, and communities that care about shopping sustainably and supporting their neighborhood economy. It’s designed to empower the overlooked, simplify discovery, and strengthen local connections all through the power of proximity. NearCart offers a seamless, hyperlocal shopping experience with features like real-time product search to instantly connect users with nearby sellers, interactive store listings that display distance, prices, and product visuals, and built-in navigation using Google Maps for smooth routing. Even without a specific search, users can browse nearby shops through a discovery mode that acts like a live marketplace map. The app integrates essential APIs for location tracking and inventory access, includes secure authentication with external providers, and was built completely via AI prompt engineering using Bolt AI without writing a single line of traditional code.",

      "description": "World Time – Global Clock Platform World Time is a multilingual web platform designed to solve the universal challenge of checking the exact time and time differences for all countries and major cities worldwide. The inspiration came from the frustration of coordinating meetings, travel, and communication across time zones—especially for remote teams, travelers, and anyone with global connections. Most existing tools are limited, lack real-time accuracy, or don’t support major world languages like Arabic and French.  Who is it for? Remote teams and businesses working across continents  Travelers and digital nomads  Students and educators  Anyone who needs to coordinate or compare times globally  Key Features Instant search, add, and compare: Real-time analog and digital clocks for any location, with second-by-second accuracy.  Comprehensive coverage: 200+ countries and all major cities, organized by continent.  Multilingual support: English, Arabic (RTL), French, German, and more.  Time zone details: UTC offsets, time zone abbreviations, and Daylight Saving Time indicators.  Personalized dashboard: Add or remove multiple clocks, create your own world time view.  Responsive, modern UI: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile, with light/dark mode.  Offline fallback: If the user loses connection, the app gracefully falls back to device time.  Always accurate: All times are auto-synced with reliable world time APIs.  Integrations & Tech Stack Built with Bolt.new (React/Next.js)  World time APIs (e.g., worldtimeapi.org) for real-time accuracy  i18n libraries for seamless multilingual and RTL support  Netlify for deployment  Supabase for optional user data and authentication  Custom domain via Entri + IONOS  Example Prompt Used to Build the App  World Time - Global Time Platform Create a comprehensive, production-ready world time application with the following specifications:  Core Application Features 1.

It was inspired by our own struggles—constantly juggling multiple insurance documents, reminders, and logins across different platforms like Google Sheets, WhatsApp chats with agents, and email threads. We realized there was no central, user-friendly tool built specifically for families to stay organized and secure with their policies.  This app is for anyone managing multiple insurance policies—whether for themselves, parents, spouses, or children—across life, health, vehicle, and other types of insurance.  🔑 Key Features: Dashboard to view all active policies  Family member-based organization  Policy reminders (renewal, premium dates, maturity, etc.)  Cloud-based access for safe storage  Filter and search by policy type, company, or member  Mobile-friendly interface  The goal: No more missed premiums, no lost documents, and no confusion—just peace of mind and better control over your family’s insurance.",

As a generation dealing with social pressure, economic uncertainty, and mental health stigma, many suffer in silence.  The idea was inspired by how powerful voice can be in connecting people—not just through words, but through tone, emotion, and presence. We wanted to build a digital space that didn’t just let people vent, but helped them feel heard, guided, and uplifted.  EchoRoom is for anyone navigating difficult emotions, from stress and loneliness to a need for motivation or hope. Whether you're a student, a young professional, or simply someone needing emotional support, EchoRoom offers an AI-powered voice-based platform where you can join themed rooms like Hopeful, Lonely, Motivated, or Calm.",

      "title": "SpeakDude is an language learning platform that focuses on real conversation practice through realistic AI avatars and translation challenges",
      "description": "The idea for SpeakDude came from a deeply personal struggle that millions of language learners face every day. Like many others, I wanted to become fluent in English, but I found myself constantly stumbling over words, hesitating mid-sentence, and making embarrassing mistakes. The fear of being judged by others was so overwhelming that I often chose silence over speaking, which only made my fluency worse.  I realized that traditional language learning apps focus heavily on grammar rules and vocabulary memorization, but they completely miss the most crucial skill: actually speaking. You can know thousands of words and perfect grammar, but if you can't speak confidently in real conversations, you're not truly fluent.  The breakthrough moment came when I understood that what language learners really need is a judgment-free practice partner - someone who won't laugh at mistakes, won't get impatient with stuttering, and is available 24/7 to practice with.

      "description": "Inspiration: Growing up in Rwanda and working closely with students, cyber cafés, and self-taught developers, I noticed a common limitation: most creative and developer tools require constant internet access, subscriptions, or powerful devices. That left many talented people without access to basic tools they needed.  We asked ourselves ,what if creativity didn’t depend on any of that? What if someone could edit videos, compress images, test APIs, write code, convert files, or create documents, all in the browser, completely offline?  That’s what inspired EditForge Pro — an all-in-one creative and developer suite designed to run entirely in the browser, with zero setup, zero sign-up, and complete privacy.  What it does EditForge Pro is a browser-based suite of over 25 tools that work completely offline. It covers a wide range of needs:  For creatives: video, audio, image editors, PDF tools, quote generators, and more  For developers: code editor, API tester, JSON formatter, hash and password tools  For students and researchers: text editor, lyrics finder, Wikipedia search  For everyday users: file converters, QR and calendar generators, screen recorder, unit converter, and more  All tools are designed to work without relying on APIs, external services, or user accounts. Everything runs locally, offering privacy and reliability.  How we built it EditForge Pro was developed using:  HTML, CSS (with Tailwind) for the user interface  Vanilla JavaScript modules for logic and tool isolation  Vite.js as the bundler and development environment  IndexedDB and LocalStorage to store preferences and process files locally  Service Workers for offline-first behavior  Netlify for free and fast global deployment  Each tool was built modularly, allowing them to work independently while sharing a consistent design and experience.  Challenges we ran into One of the biggest challenges was building offline-first tools that typically rely on APIs or cloud infrastructure. Features like Wik",

      "title": "AI Resume Matcher",
      "description": "Last month, a friend of mine called me sounding defeated. He’d been applying to dozens of jobs, sending out resume after resume, and wasn’t getting a single callback. “I just wish I knew what I’m doing wrong,” he said. That one line hit me — because I’ve worked in the HR space for years, and I’ve seen this happen from the other side too.  The truth is, most job applications never even make it to a recruiter. Around 78% of resumes get filtered out by software — the ATS systems companies use to scan and shortlist candidates. Good people often get ignored simply because their resume doesn’t match the exact keywords or format the system is looking for. They’re not rejected for lack of talent — they’re just lost in translation.  That’s when it clicked. With my experience in HR, I know how the backend works. I’ve seen how systems scan resumes, what recruiters look for, and where candidates often go wrong. So I thought — why not turn that insight into something useful for job seekers? Why not build a solution that gives people real feedback, based on how these systems actually work?  That’s how AI Resume Matcher was born. It’s a simple tool that helps job seekers stop guessing and start applying smarter. You just upload your resume, paste the job description (or job link), and get an instant match score. It shows you what you’re missing, what you’ve done right, and exactly how to improve. If you need help fixing it, the AI can even generate improved resume content or a tailored cover letter on the spot.  This isn’t just another resume builder. It’s built from real HR experience, powered by smart AI, and designed to give job seekers the edge they need. Whether you're switching careers, just starting out, or trying to land that dream job — this tool makes the process feel more in your control.  Instead of applying to 50 jobs and hearing nothing, people can now send 10 well-optimized resumes and actually get results. I’ve seen how frustrating job searching can be — and this i",

Built using Bolt, OpenAI, and Netlify, Lab2Life includes:  Experiment Passport (gamified global learning)  AI Lab Assistant (Beta) for science Q&A, built using OpenAI and soon to be powered offline with Gemma 3n  Family Ripple Effect — students replicate experiments at home with parents  Impact Tracker + Student Showcase to celebrate global creativity  Lab2Life solves the passive-learning problem and bridges the school-to-home science gap — especially for underserved schools. It’s built for Grades 3–12, but designed to spark lifelong curiosity.",

Inspired by how people often scrub to the last few minutes of reviews to hear the final verdict, we built a tool that analyzes that exact segment using AI.  It’s for Gen Z, busy professionals, or anyone who wants smart, fast summaries of YouTube reviews. Just search or paste a YouTube link and ReviewVerse AI delivers:  Summarized reviewer opinions  Verdicts with sentiment scoring  Tabs for Movies and Products  Support for custom links and multiple languages  Filtering by reviewer or category  Gemini API for summarization  YouTube API for review discovery  The core prompt: “Summarize the last 2–3 minutes of this video as a final verdict or opinion from the reviewer. Be concise and highlight any strong sentiments.”  Built with React, Tailwind, Flask, Gemini API, and YouTube APIs.",

      "description": "Datrix is an AI-powered data automation platform that eliminates the tedious manual work of processing business documents. Built after witnessing teams at major retail suppliers spend hours typing purchase orders and invoices line-by-line into their systems, Datrix automatically scans emails for important business documents, extracts and cleans the data using specialized AI agents, and pushes it directly into CRMs and databases—no human intervention required. The platform features three core modules: fully automated email processing that works 24/7 in the background, DatrixAI chatbot for on-demand document processing with user confirmation, and intelligent data analysis that generates charts and insights from plain English queries. What makes Datrix special is its ability to handle the messy, real-world chaos of business documents—from potato-quality scanned PDFs to inconsistently formatted spreadsheets—while providing businesses with clean, actionable data and giving their teams time back to focus on actually growing their business instead of just managing it.",

      "description": "Inspiration As a 15-year-old JEE aspirant, my life is built around study schedules, problem sets, and pressure. Everyone around me expects academic excellence, not creative expression. I’ve often heard:  “Coding won’t take you anywhere right now.” “Why waste time on side projects?”  But I’ve always known that I wasn’t built just to follow a syllabus. I wanted to build something that felt like mine.  Late one night, drained after coaching, I opened Bolt.New. No installs, no distractions — just an open canvas and a crazy idea:  What if photo editing could be lightning-fast, powerful like Photoshop, simple like Canva, and all in the browser?  That’s how ADIFI was born. Not just a tool, but my rebellion against rote learning and my belief that I can create something real — even when no one believes in me.  What it does Adifi(AKA photo studio pro) is a lightning-fast, privacy-first photo editor that works completely in-browser. It combines the precision of Photoshop with the simplicity of Canva, without requiring any downloads or uploads.  Features:  Multi-layer editing (images, text, effects)  Real-time filters (brightness, contrast, blur, vignette, etc.)  AI-powered background removal (using BodyPix)  Instant exports (with zero server processing)  Fully responsive UI with keyboard shortcuts and live previews  How we built it Built entirely in Bolt.New using vibe coding — described my vision and let AI scaffold the architecture.  Used React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for structure and styling.  Built a custom Canvas engine to handle layers, effects, and pixel manipulations.  Integrated TensorFlow.js and BodyPix for client-side AI features like background removal.  Added undo/redo functionality, image state tracking, and real-time performance stats.  Challenges we ran into Balancing studies and coding: Working on ADIFI late at night, after long coaching days, was emotionally and mentally draining.  Performance bottlenecks: Large image processing would slow the browse",

      "description": "## Inspiration The Mind Share was born from a deeply personal struggle. For years, despite a history of academic success, I found myself battling severe memory and concentration problems. These cognitive gaps began to profoundly affect my life, my work, and my ability to learn new things. The breaking point came during my professional career; I failed multiple job interviews due to an inability to recall key details under pressure, and in the rare instances I was hired, my tenure lasted only a few days.  Facing this reality, I decided I had to act. I couldn't find a job that could accommodate my challenges, so I resolved to create my own. My goal was to build the very tool I needed—a solution not just for me, but for anyone else feeling adrift in a sea of mental fog. This project is my answer to that struggle.  ## What it does The Mind Share is a cognitive acceleration platform designed to function as an \"exocortex\"—an external, artificial brain that assists and augments your own. It's built on two core pillars:  Écho - The Real-Time Cognitive Co-Pilot: This is the heart of the application. Écho is a live, conversational AI agent you can \"call\" for instant help. Using technologies like Tavus, it engages in real-time audio and video conversations. It's designed to be multimodal, audio, live video from your camera, and even your screen share to understand your context and provide immediate assistance. Whether you need to remember a detail, focus on a task, or solve a complex problem, Écho is there to bridge the gap.  Collective Intelligence & Community: The platform is designed to facilitate mutual aid.  Shared Knowledge: It anonymously collects and analyzes interaction patterns, reasoning techniques, and prompting strategies from its users. This creates a unique, living knowledge base that the AI draws from, allowing it to provide solutions based on real, effective human intelligence. AI Chat: Users can engage with various AI providers (like Gemini, Mistral, Claude, ",

I wanted to create a calm, ambient space online — part ritual, part refuge — where people could step away from noise and return to themselves. It’s not about journaling, networking, or gamified mindfulness. It’s about mood-first design, intuitive rituals, and a shared sense of emotional presence.

      "description": "About This Project: Flights Overhead  What Inspired Me  I flew from San Diego to Seattle, then Seattle to Victoria, BC yesterday for a vacation! As I approached each airport, I found myself watching planes take off and land, and wondered: Where are they going? Where did they come from?  That same curiosity often strikes me at home - I live below a flight path and constantly hear aircraft flying overhead. I wanted a tool that could tell me, in real-time, where those planes are headed or returning from. This app is the result of that moment of curiosity.  What I Learned  This was my first time working with both the Mapbox Geocoding API and the FlightAware AeroAPI, and I’m thrilled with how much I’ve expanded my understanding of live geospatial APIs.  I also gained hands-on experience with Supabase Edge Functions, which helped me improve my error handling, environment variable management, and middleware API routing.  How I Built It  The entire application was structured from one comprehensive Bolt prompt that included:  Geolocation and address-based input Mapbox Geocoding to turn addresses into coordinates FlightAware to fetch live nearby flights and calculate the closest one Supabase Edge Function to handle secure API calls React + Tailwind + open-source fonts for a responsive, vintage-style frontend Mobile-first layout with full accessibility, loading states, and error handling Every piece of functionality and design was planned in that initial Bolt prompt. Follow-up prompts were used only for fixing Supabase edge function errors and polishing output. Built With  Bolt (one-prompt workflow) Supabase Mapbox Geocoding API FlightAware AeroAPI React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript Fonts: Share Tech Mono, DM Sans",

It solves the problem of finding reliable, granular accessibility information (like exact ramp details, quiet spaces, or specific dietary care) that standard city guides just don't offer.  It's for anyone with specific needs—from pregnant parents and people with mobility issues to those with sensory sensitivities or dietary restrictions—who want to confidently enjoy cities.  CityEase provides a detailed directory of venues, focusing on precise accessibility features rather than vague labels. It's designed to be easy to use on your phone, with future plans for user-contributed reviews and smart recommendations (AI) to make exploring cities truly effortless and inclusive for everyone.",

      "description": "🚀 Vidyaa – Learning Made for the TikTok Generation 🌱 What Inspired Us I’m a Grade 10 student, and I’ve been using Duolingo for over 4 years now. Without any tuition or extra prep, I consistently top my Spanish class, just by casually doing Duolingo every day.  That’s what inspired my dad and me:  \"Why isn’t the rest of school this effortless and fun?\"  We started brainstorming. What followed by days of research and reading on what makes Duolingo click. Chunking, Micro Learning, and Spaced repetitions. What if we took the same bite-sized, gamified learning model and applied it to school subjects, especially ones I and my classmates struggle with? That’s how Vidyaa was born.  It started as a way for me to dogfood my own learning, and has grown into a much larger vision.  🧠 What We Learned Gamified micro-learning works incredibly well, especially for people with short attention spans. (I am the proof.) Students don’t hate studying; they hate boring, one-size-fits-all methods. AI + education = powerful combo. It can personalize, adapt, and accelerate mastery. Building something for yourself first is the best way to make sure it works. 🛠️ How We Built It We started with subjects I study in school, like English, Maths, Physics, etc for IGCSE Class 9 & 10. We broke down chapters into bite-sized lessons, and used AI to generate:  Subjects, Sections and Units with bite-sized courses for learning Smart, spaced quizzes Active recall challenges Personalized learning journeys We used:  React Native for a sleek mobile-first UI Supabase and Node.js backend Perplexity & ChatGPT to generate curriculum-aligned content and auto-grade quiz responses A tutor marketplace for students needing 1:1 help from subject experts Everything was tested and refined using my real class curriculum. I was the first user and critic.  ⚔️ Challenges We Faced Making content engaging and academically rigorous at the same time Building adaptive quizzes that stay relevant as a student progresses Ensuring",

And the crushing silence in dialysis wards — where every patient started with just a few missed signs.  Every 3 out of 5 kidney failures begin with uncontrolled diabetes or blood pressure. Each dialysis patient costs families and health systems up to $60,000/year. But the biggest cost? Time lost, dignity compromised, and decisions delayed.  So we sat with patients. We interviewed doctors. We sifted through handwritten charts, broken apps, and forgotten prescriptions.  They all echoed the same pain:  “I don’t remember what changed last time.”  “Which app was I using again?”  “I missed my follow-up.”  “I forgot when to take my meds.”  That’s when we knew — data wasn’t enough. They didn’t need another tracker. They needed a memory. A guide. A medical companion.  And so, we built KBD Guardian — the AI-powered health guardian that thinks like a doctor and cares like family.  What it does KBD Guardian is a mobile-first, real-time medical web app that tracks and connects all vital signs for kidney patients, diabetics, and those with high blood pressure — while keeping doctors and caregivers always in the loop.",

I built it solo using Bolt.new, Supabase (auth, DB, edge functions), Stripe (plan management), and OpenAI.

Built for founders, solo operators, and busy teams, it integrates real-time transcription (Google Speech + ElevenLabs), GPT-4 for intent parsing, and APIs for task execution.  It saves time, reduces context-switching, and shows what AI-assisted work could feel like in 2025.",

The problem: when you speak at events, you rarely get access to attendee data due to privacy laws, so valuable leads are lost.  SpeakerStacks solves this by giving every speaker a branded landing page (accessible via QR codes) with built-in lead capture, GDPR-compliant consent, CRM integrations, and ROI tracking.  We’ve added features like a gamified credit system to reward referrals, a post-event ROI calculator, and one-click integrations with tools like MailerLite, HubSpot, and Salesforce.  In short: you speak, we help you capture, convert, and measure the results.",

We wanted to build a tool that empowered people like us-curious, driven, but unsupported-to not just trade, but to trade with confidence and clarity.

Each cat you catch earns 1 point, and you have just 30 seconds to score as high as possible. Cats vanish quickly, so speed and sharp eyes are key.

This app was born from the belief that taking just one moment each day to reflect can lead to greater self-awareness, gratitude, and personal growth.  The concept emphasizes quality over quantity - rather than overwhelming users with lengthy journaling requirements, it focuses on capturing that one special moment, thought, or feeling that stood out each day. This approach makes journaling accessible and sustainable for people who might feel intimidated by traditional journaling apps.  What it does \"One Moment A Day\" is a beautifully designed mobile journaling app that helps users capture and reflect on meaningful moments from their daily lives. Here's what makes it special:  Core Features: Daily Prompts: Each day presents users with a thoughtful, randomly selected prompt to inspire reflection (e.g., \"What made you smile today?\", \"Describe a moment that surprised you today\") One Entry Per Day: Users can only save one entry per day, encouraging intentional reflection rather than overwhelming journaling. Beautiful UI: Features an aurora-inspired background with smooth animations and a calming color scheme Offline-First: Works seamlessly offline with automatic sync when connection is restored End-to-End Encryption: All journal entries are encrypted using user-specific keys for complete privacy Smart Notifications: Personalized reminder notifications that adapt based on user's streak and behavior Streak Tracking: Motivates users with current and longest streak tracking Search & History: Easy access to past entries with sea",

      "description": "The BoardRoomAI is a next-generation decision-making platform designed to eliminate the isolation and uncertainty that comes with facing complex challenges. It provides every user with a personal, on-demand \"Board of Directors\"—a council of specialized AI personas who collaborate to offer multi-faceted guidance. What problem does it solve? We've all been there: stuck at a crossroads with a major life or business decision, wishing we could consult a team of experts—a seasoned executive, an empathetic mentor, an innovative thinker. But this level of advice is inaccessible and expensive. People are left to rely on one-dimensional chatbots or lonely Google searches. Our platform solves this by democratizing high-level advisory. We replace the single, generic AI answer with a dynamic, multi-perspective discussion, ensuring every decision is examined from all critical angles. Who is it for? This is for the ambitious doers: Startup Founders wrestling with strategy, hiring, and pivots. Product Managers seeking diverse input on feature development and roadmaps. Career Changers navigating the uncertainty of a new professional path. Anyone facing a significant life decision who needs a trusted, confidential sounding board. Key Features & Functionality: Our platform is built around a seamless, multi-modal experience designed to replicate and enhance real-world advisory sessions: The Intelligent Orchestrator: This is our core innovation. When a user asks a question, our backend AI (powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash) doesn't just respond. It first analyzes the query's intent and assembles the perfect team of AI advisors from our roster. It then facilitates a real-time group chat where the advisors build on, and even challenge, each other's ideas to provide a comprehensive answer. Live Group Voice Calls: Users can instantly escalate any text chat into a live, interactive group voice call. Powered by ElevenLabs' Conversational AI, each advisor responds with their own unique, lifelike voi",

An AI agent connects learners with trained users based on the skills the learner wants to learn and the skills the user can teach, all while making that connection faster, smarter, better, and meaningful.  The Problem: Most people can't afford an expensive course; even if they can take a course, they often don't know where to start. Not to mention all of the people who are using their skill sets for a job but typically don't have a trusted way of connecting with learners who want to learn.  Who it's for: Students, self-learners, creators, anyone who wants to grow by learning from another person.",

The inspiration came from firsthand experience—realizing how disorienting it can be to manage severance paperwork, benefit deadlines, and emotional stress without guidance.  The app offers a calm and structured approach. After a short onboarding flow, users receive a personalized dashboard that displays important deadlines (like WARN Act and COBRA dates), a tailored action plan, helpful checklists (based on whether they still have access to company systems), and a dedicated space to log accomplishments for resume-building or interviews.  Built with Vite, React, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, Layoff Relief ensures user privacy with row-level security and secure authentication.",

      "description": "What it does Pohi AI Pro is a sophisticated database and logistics application designed to revolutionize how manufacturers and their customers interact. At its core, it:  Connects Stakeholders: It serves as a central hub for customers (buyers) to submit their product demands and for manufacturers to list their available stock. Manages Orders & Stock: The system facilitates the uploading of detailed order requirements by customers and available inventory by manufacturers. A key feature is its AI-powered capability to automatically match these demands with suitable stock. Provides Role-Specific Interfaces: It offers tailored user interfaces for three distinct roles: Customers: Can submit new demands (including specialized ones like acacia pole orders) and track their existing demands, benefiting from AI suggestions for alternatives or status explanations. Manufacturers: Can list new stock items, manage their inventory, and leverage AI tools for price suggestions, marketing text generation, product photo generation, and listing quality analysis. Administrators: Have a comprehensive overview of the platform, manage users and system-wide stock, utilize advanced AI-driven matchmaking tools, plan logistics (including truck loading and routing), handle billing, and access AI-generated reports and system health dashboards. Features Smart Logistics & Planning: One of its standout features is AI-driven logistics organization. This includes: Matchmaking: AI suggests optimal pairings between customer demands and manufacturer stock. Truck Planning: AI can generate optimal loading plans for trucks (e.g., 24-ton capacity), considering multi-pickup and multi-drop-off scenarios to maximize efficiency. It also provides route suggestions and can draft communications for carriers. Cost Estimation: AI assists in estimating logistics costs. AI-Powered Assistance: Throughout the application, Gemini AI is integrated to provide various forms of assistance, such as generating alternative prod",

If you've ever called a friend to stay on the phone you walked home, or sent a \"made it!\" text at midnight, you already know why Birdzie exists. For so many us, personal safety isn't just about emergencies, it's about just feeling comfortable in our normal, everday lives. I started Birdzie because I was frustrated by safety apps built by people who just didn't really get it from a woman's point of view, or really any marginalized-minority point of view. As a woman, a mom, a friend, and (I'd like to think) good person - I'm constantly thinking about my family, my friends, even just the people around me) and wanted to create a solution that felt human, supportive, lightweight, and easy enough to use everyday. Something I'd- we'd-want to use everyday.",

This creates issues like:  Difficulty finding credible healers  Lack of standard booking and communication channels  No visibility into healer expertise or reviews  No digital tools for healers to manage their practice  💡 What Inspired It? As someone deeply rooted in African heritage and passionate about health access, I saw how undervalued and unsupported traditional healers are in the digital world. Many operate informally through Facebook groups or WhatsApp. I wanted to build a trusted, empowering bridge between ancient wisdom and modern tech — honoring our traditions while giving healers tools to thrive.  👥 Who Is It For? Patients who want to safely find and consult with traditional healers.  Healers who want to grow their practice, reach more clients, and manage bookings professionally.  Cultural advocates who care about preserving indigenous knowledge.  🚀 Key Features 🔎 Search & Filter: Find healers by specialisation (e.g., fertility, child health, dream interpretation)  💬 Messaging: Patients and healers can chat securely in-app  📆 Bookings: Patients can request consultations (synchronous or scheduled)  ⭐ Ratings & Reviews: Build credibility through client feedback  🛍️ Healer Shop: Each healer can sell herbal products from their own mini-shop  📚 Healer Blogs & Events: Culturally rich content to engage and educate  🛠️ Admin Tools for Healers: Manage sessions, block off time, track clients  🔗 Google Calendar Sync: Automatically manage healer availability  🛡️ Verification & Approval: Platform verifies healer credentials for patient safety",

AI Department transforms a single question—“How do we launch our product?”—into research insights, strategic positioning, persuasive copy, process checklists, and distribution ideas, all in one go, giving lean teams the firepower of a full growth department.",

      "description": "💡 Problem It Solves / Inspiration: When I started building with Bolt.new, I realized most resources focused on individual features or UI elements — but there was no clear workflow that explained when to use what, or how to chain prompts together for real outcomes.  So, I began documenting my own trial-and-error process. Over time, I refined a system that consistently produced strong Bolt builds using structured prompts, UI feedback loops, and micro-systems.  That became Magic Prompts Workflow — a resource for:  Beginners who want to build real projects faster  Prompt engineers refining their process  Bolt.new users looking to create smarter, not harder  ⚙️ Key Features: Interactive Documentation: Learn by following real-world prompt loops  Progress Tracking: See your learning status as you go  Searchable Prompt Library: Curated prompts for every stage of development  Mobile-First Design: Optimized for usability on any device  Built-in Theme Toggle + Scroll Animations for better UX  🚀 Built Entirely on Bolt.new Modular sections  Scroll-based navigation  Custom layout logic  Progress state with context provider  Clean, responsive design using Framer Motion + Tailwind CSS  Refined using a 6M+ token iterative process  ✨ Actual Prompt Used to Start the Project: “Build a structured documentation website for developers learning to build with Bolt.new. It should guide users from idea to deployment using a prompt-based development workflow. Include a homepage, progress tracker, reusable sections for each topic, and a prompt library that can be filtered. The tone should be modern, helpful, and minimal. Fully responsive, mobile-first, and clean UI.”  🔗 Live Site: https://magicprompts.netlify.app",

      "description": "### **Inspiration**  The inspiration for Pohi AI Pro came directly from real-world experience in the acacia wood pole manufacturing industry. Selling these products globally highlighted significant inefficiencies and a clear need for a centralized system to connect manufacturers with ready stock to customers looking to place orders, and to streamline the complex logistics involved.  ### **What it does**  Pohi AI Pro is a sophisticated database and logistics application designed to revolutionize how manufacturers and their customers interact. At its core, it:  * **Connects Stakeholders:** It serves as a central hub for customers (buyers) to submit their product demands and for manufacturers to list their available stock.   * **Manages Orders & Stock:** The system facilitates the uploading of detailed order requirements by customers and available inventory by manufacturers. A key feature is its AI-powered capability to automatically match these demands with suitable stock.   * **Provides Role-Specific Interfaces:** It offers tailored user interfaces for three distinct roles:     * **Customers:** Can submit new demands (including specialized ones like acacia pole orders) and track their existing demands, benefiting from AI suggestions for alternatives or status explanations.     * **Manufacturers:** Can list new stock items, manage their inventory, and leverage AI tools for price suggestions, marketing text generation, product photo generation, and listing quality analysis.     * **Administrators:** Have a comprehensive overview of the platform, manage users and system-wide stock, utilize advanced AI-driven matchmaking tools, plan logistics (including truck loading and routing), handle billing, and access AI-generated reports and system health dashboards.",

We were inspired by the lack of a place where one could find authentic, quality crafts created by talented local artists. We solve the problem of market \"uniformity\" by offering pieces that have a soul and a story behind them.  2. Who is it for?  Our store is for people who appreciate the value of handmade goods. It's for those who seek unique pieces that tell a story, whether for home decor or for giving a deeply meaningful gift. These are customers who prefer to support small creators and value quality over quantity.  3. Key features, functionality, and integrations  Our e-commerce store stands out for its focus on the story behind each piece. Every product comes with a detailed description of its origin and the artisan who created it. Additionally, we have a secure shipping system and special packaging to protect the items. We use secure payment integrations to ensure a smooth buying experience",

      "description": "What problem does it solve, or what inspired you to build it? Who is it for?  CareerCraft was built to solve a frustrating but common problem: the job application process is time-consuming, repetitive, and emotionally draining. Many job seekers—especially early-career professionals and career switchers—struggle to tailor resumes and cover letters for each role, often resorting to generic content that doesn't reflect their true potential.  The inspiration came from personal experience and observing peers: talented individuals missing opportunities simply because they were overwhelmed by the application workload or unsure how to present themselves effectively.  CareerCraft is for anyone actively applying for jobs—students, recent graduates, professionals pivoting careers, and even career coaches looking for tools to help their clients. It’s designed to make personalized applications faster, smarter, and easier.  Key features & functionality:  Profile Setup: A dynamic, multi-section form for users to input personal info, work experience, education, and skills.  Job Input: Accepts job descriptions via text or URL, with automatic AI parsing.  AI-Powered Document Generation: Tailored resumes and personalized cover letters using GPT-3.5-turbo, with anti-hallucination prompt safeguards.  Live Preview & Download: Users can review content and download job-specific documents instantly.  Modern UI/UX: Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and a mobile-friendly, responsive layout.  Local-First Approach: Uses browser localStorage for fast performance and user privacy.  By combining smart prompt design, a clean interface, and fast document generation, CareerCraft helps users apply with confidence—without the burnout.",

You can even create fun combinations, like turning a dish vegan, then packing it with protein. Recipes and variants are linked like a deck of cards that you can swipe through. Built for amateur home chefs who love collecting and experimenting with recipes, it's designed to become your personal cloud-based cookbook with a sprinkle of AI magic. The beta version is available on web, but long-term, Cookidex will be an app in your pocket, just like a real-life Pokédex, made for your culinary adventures.",

      "description": "The inspiration for LinguaFlow stems from a deeply personal and widely shared challenge within the private language tutoring community. As a part-time online language tutor with over 50 students monthly, I experienced firsthand the immense burden of lesson preparation. Understanding each student's unique needs, crafting personalized lesson plans, and then tailoring interactive materials for every single session became more time-consuming than the actual teaching. This problem isn't isolated; it's a struggle shared by over a million private one-on-one language tutors globally who are often overlooked by giant platforms like Preply and Italki, which primarily focus on learners. I realized there was a massive market gap: a need for a tool that empowers tutors, reduces their administrative load, and allows them to scale their impact without sacrificing personalization. LinguaFlow was born from this necessity – to transform hours of tedious work into seconds of intelligent creation, keeping the human touch at its core.",

The few I found were lacking in audio library or functionality, so I knew something better could be built. I've always felt that there was a gap on the internet for a platform focused on giving audio-creation powers and tools to users. We have Instagram for photos, YouTube for videos, Twitter for text, GIPHY for GIFs, and now Bickqr is here for short audio memes. Think of it as the GIPHY for audio. Bickqr helps you share audio memes. It enables you to create audio memes from videos or popular sounds by extracting and trimming them, then making them accessible on the platform for anyone to share and use. It makes the entire process as easy as possible—from creation to sharing—so that you can send whatever sound you want when texting.",

Focused on simplicity and learner engagement, Rise Social helps participants practise real-world skills in just a few minutes, making learning feel conversational, practical, and immediately relevant. \"As a learning experience designer working regularly in Articulate Rise, I'd wanted journal functionality for ages — it's such a key part of effective learning programs. While working on a suite of leadership materials, I found myself wanting that journal tool in Rise again. So I thought... let's just make it! When the journal worked beautifully, I thought a discussion tool would be cool. Then polling... then video clipping... then an AI chatbot... I decided to stop at six widgets because, well, I had a go-live date to meet! 😄",

      "description": "ListSpace.app is your personal hub for capturing, organizing, and tracking everything from ideas and to-dos to random scribbles and project notes.   I built ListSpace.app because most productivity tools are either too rigid or overloaded with features you don’t need every day. I wanted a space that’s flexible, fast, and enjoyable. A place where I could quickly jot down thoughts, organize them into lists, and see progress over time without distractions.   ListSpace.app is for anyone who wants a simple, beautiful way to manage tasks, projects, or even just daily inspiration. Whether you’re a freelancer, student, creator, or just a fan of staying organized.  Key features: - Effortless list and board creation - Drag-and-drop for easy organization - Secure file and image attachments via DigitalOcean Spaces - Real-time sync with Supabase - Clean, distraction-free interface - Handy integrations for productivity  I created ListSpace.app to make idea management simple, visual, and fun, so you can focus on what matters most.",

Traditional tools rely on keyword matching, job titles, or rigid templates that reduce a person’s journey to a set of checkboxes. This leaves out those who’ve switched paths, taken breaks, worked across sectors, or grown in unconventional ways.  💡Skillo tackles this with empathy and intelligence.💡 Skillo performs a full-scale career analysis, tracing your professional arc, recognizing your growth, and interpreting the choices and pivots that shaped your journey. It draws inferences, understands patterns, surfaces overlooked skills, and offers thoughtful, practical next steps. It shows people what roles they fit into, where their gaps are, and what options they might not have considered — including alternate roles that are realistic and reachable.  In doing so, it supports not just job seekers, but people in transition — from employed to unemployed, from stuck to searching, from uncertain to clear.  💡 Innovation💡 Skillo improves on existing solutions by going beyond surface-level keyword scanning. Most resume tools offer optimization based on what an algorithm or ATS might want. Skillo flips that — it’s built to understand what you bring to the table, not just how to game the system.  💡It innovates by:💡  Analyzing your full career arc — not just recent roles  Using natural language understanding to uncover transferable skills and hidden strengths  Offering role suggestions, alternate career paths, and targeted upskilling — all grounded in your real experience.  💡Skillo is a discovery engine for your career.💡 It reveals what’s been true all along — that you are more than your last job title. It gives people the words, direction, and confidence to move forward with clarity.  And in a world where so many feel invisible, stuck, or underestimated — that kind of ins",

      "description": "Creating high quality AI generated videos is both time consuming and expensive. Crafting the perfect prompt often requires multiple iterations, and generic prompts typically focus only on basic elements like the subject and environment while ignoring critical cinematic aspects such as camera angles, shot types, lighting, and visual effects.  As video generation becomes more mainstream, creators need a smarter way to build rich and detailed prompts that translate into visually compelling results.   I took a cinematic scene and reverse-engineered it, breaking it down into key components:  Character & Action – including Age, Subject, Emotion, and Activity. Environment & Atmosphere – such as Location, Time of Day, and Mood. Cinematic Details – like Camera Shot Type, Movement, and Angle. Visuals & Tone – covering Lighting, Aesthetics, VFX, Color Palette, Audio, and Resolution. Dialogue – for adding spoken elements.  By filling in these guided inputs, you’re essentially crafting a complete cinematic scene—one that’s ready to be copied directly into AI video generation platforms for high-quality output.",

      "description": "As a founder I attend countless pitch nights, demo days, and coffee meet-ups. By the end of each week my pockets are stuffed with business cards and my LinkedIn inbox is full of “nice to meet you” messages, but when a real problem surfaces I cannot remember which of those contacts actually fits the challenge. I wanted a tool that would treat every introduction as data, tie it to my business goals, and surface the one expert or company that can move the needle right now. Tagramp began as that personal itch: turning random networking into a goal-centric, ROI-driven engine for growth and collaboration. What it does Tagramp is an AI-first SaaS platform that converts static contact lists into living, goal-oriented opportunities.  AI profile generation I paste a website URL, PDF deck, or plain text. Natural-language models summarise the material and create a concise company or personal profile plus a short list of top-level goals.  Goal-centric matching Those goals feed an intelligent matcher that scans verified professionals and organisations—either public communities or networks I import. The algorithm scores each potential connection on relevance, complementary expertise, and past success.  Instant collaboration framework When a match is found the system produces a “Ramp-a-Plan,” an editable roadmap and a ready-to-send introduction email. Instead of starting from “let’s grab coffee,” both sides see clear next steps and mutual value from day one.  Monetisable networks As a community owner I can charge subscription fees so only vetted members appear in match results, which preserves quality and creates a revenue stream.  Built-in relationship tracking A light CRM layer records email threads, Slack or WhatsApp chats, calendar events, and call notes so progress is measurable from first hello to closed deal.  Free users can browse and search manually, but AI-powered actions unlock with a five-dollar personal plan or a twenty-",

      "description": "A missed connection is when two people briefly cross paths, feel a possible connection, but don’t get the chance to talk further or exchange contact information.  I once had a brief interaction with a girl. We smiled at each other. I saw her again on a beach, but I wasn’t confident enough to approach her. I didn’t know her name, who her friends were, or where she studied. It was a huge city, and I knew the chances of ever seeing her again were slim unless destiny had something planned. But I wasn’t that lucky. I never saw her again.  Even now, that moment stays with me. I often wonder how two strangers who felt something could they ever find each other again. If they don’t know names, addresses, or any personal details. That question stayed with me and eventually sparked the idea for this project.  YouLookedAt.me is a platform where you can share your missed connection moment. If someone else posts a story that matches yours, you’ll be notified and can start a chat. It’s a space to share real, heartfelt stories, post anonymous notes, and maybe even reconnect with someone you briefly crossed paths with.  It’s all about second chances and real stories because sometimes destiny just needs a little help.",

      "description": "20% of the population is neurodiverse. There is up to a 40% unemployment rate among neurodiverse adults. And over 60% of employed neurodiverse professionals experience workplace stigma.   Elucidare are the world's first AI-powered communication tools designed specifically for neurodiverse professionals.   They help transforms workplace anxiety into workplace confidence through three core features:  (1) Tone Analyzer: analyzes incoming messages and breaks down the emotional tone with precision. No more spending hours overthinking a simple Slack message.  (2) Script Generator: generates three perfectly tailored response options for any workplace situation. Describe your scenario and receive direct response scripts with explanations of why each approach works.  (3) VoicePractice (Premium) converts your scripts to natural speech using advanced AI voices, letting you rehearse important conversations and emails before sending them. Practice your tone, timing and delivery until you feel confident.  The app tracks the users usage, saves successful scripts to a personal library and learns their communication style, creating a personalized toolkit that grows more valuable over time.  Built entirely inside Bolt.new as a solo developer, Elucidare showcases the power of modern AI-assisted development. This full-stack app demonstrates what's possible when neurodiverse minds meet cutting-edge tools.",

It’s hard to navigate, impossible to customize, and somehow still charges extra for features that should be standard.  The result? Frustration for volunteers, headaches for staff, and a lot of wasted time.  It’s time for something better. Ecclisio is a modern tool designed to serve the entire church—from first-time volunteers to experienced pastors. Its name is a modernized nod to Ekklesia, the Greek word for “church.”  Technology should empower ministry, not hinder it. It’s time the Church caught up. Welcome to Ecclisio.",

TrafficIQ solves the deadly crisis of unpredictable traffic congestion that costs lives, time, and trillions globally. I was inspired to build it after personally falling asleep in Lagos traffic and witnessing a patient die in an ambulance during the catastrophic Independence Bridge gridlock where people were trapped for 48+ hours - I realized we can predict weather and stock markets but people still drive blind into traffic disasters that kill and cost the global economy over $1 trillion annually.  Who is it for?  TrafficIQ is for daily commuters losing hours to traffic (like Lagos residents who lose 2 months yearly), emergency services needing life-saving priority routing, city governments requiring smart traffic management, logistics companies optimizing deliveries, and anyone who believes no one should die in traffic because we couldn't predict the predictable.  Key features, functionality, or integrations:  TrafficIQ provides 24-hour traffic predictions (world's first), emergency vehicle priority routing with dynamic corridors, AI-powered congestion hotspot identification, real-time alternative routes, and city-wide impact tracking that reduces commute times by 30-40%, built with Bolt.new for rapid development, Together AI for prediction algorithms, Supabase for real-time data, Google Maps API for traffic data, and deployed on Netlify - achieving 85% prediction accuracy and proving its worth by saving my 2-hour commute this morning!",

      "description": "Mathropilos: Secret Rise of the Shinobi is a web-based educational game designed for Calculus 12 students, turning textbook learning into an immersive ninja-themed adventure. What sets it apart is its direct alignment with the Nelson Calculus 12 textbook used in most schools, ensuring that students stay on track with their actual curriculum. Players customize their avatars, enter the Kingdom of Calculus, and progress through chapters (scrolls) by completing interactive lessons in the Training Tower and demonstrating mastery in the Challenge Grounds. It includes game modes like Quests (story-driven math puzzles) and Exam Trials (no-hint assessments) with real-time feedback. As students train, they earn XP, unlock gear, earn badges, and visualize their journey through animated and gamified content, making learning both rigorous and rewarding.",

      "description": "The idea for this app came directly from real-life experience. I work at a welfare boarding school, where tracking students' arrivals and departures is a constant challenge. Without a proper system, it's easy to lose sight of who's in, who's out, and who might be missing – and that lack of oversight can be critical.  Just two weeks ago, I discovered Bolt, a powerful no-code platform. I had never built anything with it before, but I decided to take on the challenge and create a real solution. I was honestly amazed at how intuitive and smart Bolt was – sometimes it even understood my needs better than I could explain them!  I learned a lot during the process: new development terms, UI/UX logic, how to build live dashboards, manage user roles, create smart alerts, and set up powerful automations and external integrations. I published the app using Netlify, and although I tried to connect a personal domain via ENTRI, I ran into technical issues – which became a valuable part of the learning journey.  Now, I'm proud not only of the app, but of the entire process – turning a real need into a smart, automated solution that supports staff, protects students, and opens the door to even more innovation ahead.",

      "description": "EMI.me is a financial planning platform designed to make EMI and loan-related decisions accessible to every Indian, regardless of language or background. The idea was born from recognizing a major gap in financial tools as most are available only in English, excluding a vast majority of India’s population from understanding the long-term impact of loans. To address this, EMI.me offers eight advanced calculators including tools for EMI affordability, loan comparisons, prepayment savings, and debt tracking. The platform supports ten major Indian languages such as Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, and Marathi, featuring native scripts and culturally relevant examples to ensure clarity and relatability. Alongside its tools, EMI.me provides over fifty guides and educational resources to improve financial literacy, complete with real-world case studies and interactive content. Designed with a mobile-first approach, it aims to empower Indians across regions to make informed financial decisions in their own language.",

      "description": "MyGuardianAngels transforms community solidarity into technology, creating a revolutionary safety network for the 81% of women worldwide affected by street harassment. The Problem: Women face a brutal reality - altering routes, avoiding streets, living in constant fear. Traditional solutions fail: police take 15+ minutes, emergency apps are cold and impersonal, self-defense isn't accessible to all. The Solution: A 2-3 minute human intervention system that transforms every caring person into a Guardian Angel. When a woman feels threatened, nearby verified community members receive alerts and can approach naturally, pretending to know her to deter aggressors. Key Features:  Ultra-realistic fake calls with hidden emergency functions in call interface buttons Smart community alerts with precise geolocation and photo identification Anti-coercion protection via secure PIN codes preventing forced cancellation International emergency system with pre-recorded messages in 6 languages Advanced privacy protection against potential infiltrated aggressors  Target Users: Women seeking safety, community members wanting to help, and organizations focused on women's protection across 11 supported countries. Built with Bolt.new in a single development sprint, showcasing AI-powered rapid prototyping for social impact. The app demonstrates how technology can restore what humanity treasures most: community solidarity transforming isolation into safety.",

Traditional platforms offer fragmented solutions, leaving users to manually hunt for resources, opportunities, and communities.    **Inspiration:** Seeing talented learners waste time searching for the *right* courses, hackathons, or mentors—instead of actually building skills—inspired SkillSync. It’s the tool I wish I had in college!    **For:**   - **Students** seeking internships, hackathons, or skill roadmaps.   - **Self-taught learners** who want curated resources (no more \"Which Python course is best?\").   - **Freelancers** looking for gigs while upskilling.    **Key Features:**   1. **AI Skill Mapper:** Generates personalized roadmaps with **LinkedIn role models, GitHub repos, Discord communities, and top-rated courses/videos**. *(Example prompt: \"I know Python basics—show me open-source projects, free advanced courses, and local hackathons.\")*   2. **Internship/Job Aggregator:** Pulls real-time listings from **LinkedIn, Wellfound, and Internshala APIs**.   3. **Hackathon & Freelance Hub:** Tracks global competitions and gigs (e.g., Devpost, Fiverr).   4. **Bias-Resistant:** Focuses on skills, not pedigree.    **Tech Highlights:**   - **AI-Powered:** NLP to match skills (e.g., \"Django\" ↔ \"Backend Development\").   - **Live Integrations:** GitHub API for trending repos, Reddit/Discord scrapers for communities.   - **Roadmap.sh-style Visuals:** Interactive skill paths.    **One-Sentence Pitch:**   *\"SkillSync is the ChatGPT meets LinkedIn for students—turning ‘How do I start?’ into a step-by-step playbook with AI-curated resources, opportunities, and communities.\"*    ---   **Why It Works:** It replaces 10+ tabs (Coursera + Reddit + GitHub + Discord) with **one AI-driven command**. 🚀",

      "description": "💡What problem does it solve, or what inspired you to build it? Who is it for?  PurpleVerse was inspired by the frustrating limitations people in low-income countries face when shopping online — especially when it comes to international payments, FOREX instability, and platform restrictions. Traditional e-commerce is often inaccessible or expensive for users in these regions, and that creates a digital divide in global trade.  I wanted to solve this by creating a borderless e-commerce platform that leverages crypto (USDC on Algorand Testnet for the prototype) as the means of payment. This removes the need for traditional financial systems and enables secure, trustless transactions worldwide — even for physical goods.  PurpleVerse is for:  Buyers who want to shop globally without payment restrictions.  Sellers looking to reach wider markets and access intelligent tools.  Emerging markets underserved by mainstream payment systems.   🔑 Key Features & Functionality  Crypto-Powered Payments Secure, escrow-based crypto transactions using USDC on Algorand. Funds are held until buyers confirm delivery.  Mock Wallet Integration For demo purposes, a hardcoded mock wallet simulates crypto payments and release flows.  AI-Assisted Seller Tools Sellers get help writing product descriptions, tracking analytics, and managing inventory through AI-powered features.  Admin Dashboard Full control panel to manage users, roles, featured products, commissions, and blog content.  Flash Sales & Featured Listings Sellers can run time-limited offers or pay to boost product visibility across the platform.  Platform Revenue Model 5% commission on every sale + featured product placement fees, all automated.  Blog and AI Chatbot (Support) Includes a built-in blog CMS and AI chatbot to assist buyers and sellers with FAQs and navigation.   🔌 Built With:  Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vite  Backend: Supabase (auth, DB, storage, functions, RLS)  Blockchain: Algorand (Testnet) using algo",

      "description": "AI Ding is a lightweight Chrome extension that plays a custom notification sound—your own ding!—when your AI assistant (like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude) finishes generating a response.  It solves a surprisingly common and overlooked problem: users often switch tabs or multitask while waiting for an AI to reply—and end up forgetting or wasting time checking back repeatedly. There’s no built-in feedback when the response is done. That creates micro-frustrations and disrupts focus.  AI Ding fixes this by giving users a simple, customizable audio alert, just like a kitchen timer. It’s for:  Busy professionals,  Students,  Developers,  Creatives,  Neurodivergent folks (especially ADHD users),  Anyone who multitasks while using AI tools.  Key Features:  🔔 Upload your own custom .mp3 or .wav (under 1MB)  🧠 Detects when AI is done responding using DOM mutation observers  🌐 Works across ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other AI web platforms  🔒 No login, no tracking—purely local experience  🚀 Built with Bolt.new to rapidly prototype, store user preferences, and streamline deployment",

The platform is designed for solo freelancers who want to professionalize their client management without enterprise-level complexity. Key features include smart proposal generation with customizable templates, milestone-driven project tracking, and revolutionary secure client portals that provide real-time project visibility without requiring client account creation. Built entirely with Bolt.new, Next.js, and Supabase, it integrates real-time updates, row-level security for multi-tenant data isolation, and a clean monochrome design system. FreelancerOS transforms the entire freelance workflow from initial proposal to project completion, enabling creators to focus on their craft while delivering exceptional client experiences that build trust and drive business growth.",

We built it to solve a deep modern problem: People often struggle to express how they really feel, or to connect beyond surface-level interactions. What if your real self could talk, even when you're not around? AlterYou lets you build an AI version of yourself — trained with your personality, tone, interests, and traits — so others can talk to your digital self, anytime, anonymously, and without filters.  It’s for anyone who’s ever wanted to be understood, remembered, or simply heard. Whether you're shy, private, expressive, or curious — AlterYou gives people a safe space to connect through living digital identities.",

      "description": "The renat.ai project was inspired by the vision of creating an advanced artificial general intelligence (AGI) assistant that can effectively help users with a wide range of tasks. The core problem it aims to solve is providing an intelligent, secure, and user-friendly conversational AI experience, moving beyond basic chatbots to offer deeper knowledge and assistance. It's built to showcase the potential of integrating powerful AI models with robust, modern web technologies.  This project is primarily for users seeking an intelligent conversational partner for various inquiries, from technology and science to general assistance. It's also a valuable resource for developers and AI enthusiasts interested in how a full-stack AI application can be built with a focus on security, performance, and user experience.  Here are some of its key features, functionalities, and integrations:  Advanced AI Integration: At its heart, renat.ai integrates with the OpenAI API to provide sophisticated chat capabilities, allowing it to understand and respond to complex queries. Secure Authentication and Database: It uses Supabase for robust user authentication and as its PostgreSQL database, ensuring secure user management and persistent storage of chat messages. Comprehensive Security Measures: Security is a paramount concern, with features like: Content Security Policy (CSP) configured in netlify.toml to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Input Validation and Rate Limiting (src/lib/security.ts) to protect against abuse and ensure data integrity. Secure Headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection) for enhanced browser security. Secure Logging (src/lib/logger.ts) for monitoring security events and authentication attempts. Modern Frontend Development: The application is built with React and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and visually appealing interface, and uses Lucide React for a consistent icon set. Dynamic User Experience: It",

Too often, trash piles up in neighborhoods, open sewage goes unnoticed or polluted lakes are ignored - not because people don't care but because they don't know where or how to report it. Safii is here to change that. The lack of a centralized, citizen-driven platform to report and track issues is what inspired me to build Safii. The name \"Safii\" comes from a Hindi word \"Safaii\" meaning cleanliness and it reflects a civic movement powered by everyday people.",

My mom was a childcare assistant, and I had the chance to see dozens of little budding artists with their drawings, stories, and dreams. But these treasures often faded away over time. One day, I wondered: \"What if I could bring these childhood memories to life?\" Doodibook was born from this deep desire to capture children’s imagination, showcase their creations, and offer them an eternal keepsake to share.  What it does Doodibook is a magical web application that transforms children’s drawings into enchanting stories and illustrations. Users can create:  The Magic Book: a personalized book, chapter by chapter, enriched with automatically generated illustrations.  The Magic Card: a shorter format, a card with a magical drawing on the front and a tender story on the back.  The Lenticular Card: a card that changes image depending on the viewing angle, revealing magic before your eyes.  At the heart of this adventure, Owly, a mischievous and kind owl, guides children and brings their stories to life with magical feathers that users can acquire.",

It solves the problem of fitness motivation by adding a real financial and social incentive tied to verified activity.  Inspired by the rise of Proof of Work and Move-to-Earn systems, FlowStake is built for athletes, health-conscious individuals, and communities who want to gamify fitness with verifiable blockchain rewards. Users connect wearables or fitness platforms like Strava, verify activity through GPS, QR codes, or peer attestations, and earn crypto (FST, ETH, or USDC) for completing their goals.  Key Features:  Smart Contract Staking on Ethereum or Base  Proof of Activity via GPS, wearables, or P2P attestation (photo, NFC, QR)  Strava integration (OAuth + Webhook)  Real-time Verification and IPFS-backed data storage  Challenge Types: Solo, Group, Relay, Checkpoint, Time-based  Reward Engine with configurable prize splits and NFT achievements  Built using Supabase, IPFS, and Ethers.js  Prompt: Build a tool that uses on-chain logic to verify off-chain actions and ties real-world behavior to crypto incentives.  FlowStake bridges the gap between health and crypto—making fitness both fun and financially rewarding.",

      "description": "Kids do not have much exposure to a wide variety of occupations, therefore most of them are unsure what career path they want to choose when they are picking their subject at school. This app is aimed at children aged 7-13, to provide a gamified experience to explore a wide variety of jobs. They can look at video insights, complete quests and earn badges. The children do not need to have their own email addresses, their logos are created by their parent or teacher. The app can be accessed individually, with a parent signing up and generating children logons, or with a teacher signing up and adding the entire class.",

      "description": "The inspiration for URHeard AI came from witnessing the broken state of traditional hiring processes. As persons who have been on both sides of the interview table, We noticed several critical pain points:  Time Inefficiency: HR teams spending 40+ hours per hire on initial screenings Inconsistent Evaluation: Different interviewers asking different questions, leading to unconscious bias Poor Candidate Experience: Long wait times and impersonal processes driving away top talent Scalability Issues: Companies struggling to handle high-volume hiring while maintaining quality The name \"URHeard\" reflects our core mission: ensuring every candidate feels truly heard and evaluated fairly, regardless of who's conducting the interview. We wanted to create a solution that would democratize the hiring process while maintaining the human touch that candidates deserve.",

The few I found were lacking in audio library or functionality, so I knew something better could be built. I've always felt that there was a gap on the internet for a platform focused on giving audio-creation powers and tools to users. We have Instagram for photos, YouTube for videos, Twitter for text, GIPHY for GIFs, and now Bickqr is here for short audio memes.Think of it as the GIPHY for audio. Bickqr helps you share audio memes. It enables you to create audio memes from videos or popular sounds by extracting and trimming them, then making them accessible on the platform for anyone to share and use. It makes the entire process as easy as possible—from creation to sharing—so that you can send whatever sound you want when texting.",

Devdash connects  business owners with a vetted pool of Webflow, WordPress, React and AI-site specialists, matching them in seconds through an AI brief-to-match engine that reads a plain-language project description and translates it into structured filters. Every seller’s profile is reviewed by hand before going live; buyers fund projects through Stripe-backed escrow, and both parties collaborate inside a shared project room that bundles chat, milestones and deliverables. Behind the scenes Devdash runs on a Supabase Postgres database (with pgvector for similarity search) and OpenAI for embeddings and function-calling, while Resend handles transactional email. The result is a focused, trustworthy space where clients find the right website professional on the first try and freelancers finally get leads tailored to their craft.",

A focused writing space, free from autocomplete and AI suggestions. Just you and your thoughts. And a community for writers to inspire one another.",

This \"boring but painful\" problem leads to significant user frustration, missed opportunities for community engagement, and underutilized local resources.",

      "description": "What Inspired Me I flew from San Diego to Seattle, then Seattle to Victoria, BC yesterday for a vacation! As I approached each airport, I found myself watching planes take off and land, and wondered: Where are they going? Where did they come from?  That same curiosity often strikes me at home - I live below a flight path and constantly hear aircraft flying overhead. I wanted a tool that could tell me, in real-time, where those planes are headed or returning from. This app is the result of that moment of curiosity.  What I Learned This was my first time working with both the Mapbox Geocoding API and the FlightAware AeroAPI, and I’m thrilled with how much I’ve expanded my understanding of live geospatial APIs.  I also gained hands-on experience with Supabase Edge Functions, which helped me improve my error handling, environment variable management, and middleware API routing.  How I Built It The entire application was structured from one comprehensive Bolt prompt that included:  Geolocation and address-based input Mapbox Geocoding to turn addresses into coordinates FlightAware to fetch live nearby flights and calculate the closest one Supabase Edge Function to handle secure API calls React + Tailwind + open-source fonts for a responsive, vintage-style frontend Mobile-first layout with full accessibility, loading states, and error handling Every piece of functionality and design was planned in that initial Bolt prompt. Follow-up prompts were used only for fixing Supabase edge function errors and polishing output.",

Unlike regular scheduling apps, Day-2-Day integrates your full schedule with your personal life. You don't just have a list of to-dos; what you have is a personalized priority schedule. A few key features 👉  👉 For new users, Day-2-Day begins with an interactive and easy onboarding process where you’ll smoothly enter preset activities — including usual daily activities (like breakfast and brushing), preset schedules (like school or work), hobbies, habits you're building, and personal projects you’re working on, etc — all through a simple, selectable and adjustable interface. Just quick taps or edits to input frequencies, durations, commute, and as much detail as possible. Yes! Your assistant takes these details into consideration when helping you plan for the day.  📝 As life goes on, add new to-dos for the current day or days ahead.  📅 Hit the “Generate Smart Schedule” button, and your assistant creates a suggested plan for the day, based on preset activities (or recurring tasks) and specific to-dos. You can move, edit, delete, and add blocks (activities on your schedule) to suit you.  ⚡ On the move? The Quick Add feature lets you drop in tasks without slowing down.  📈 Track your progress with: ✅ A habit tracker (see streaks and completion), 🎯 Task progress over time, 🌤 Daily mood check-ins, and more.

Key Features:  AI meal recommendations based on dietary preferences and what's expiring Smart shopping lists with cost optimization and store price comparisons Food waste tracker that suggests leftover transformation recipes Recipe videos with step-by-step cooking guidance Family meal coordination and budget tracking Freemium model: Free (3 meals/week) vs Premium ($9.99/month unlimited)  Why It's Different: Unlike generic meal planners, SmartMeal AI focuses on preventing food waste while saving money - addressing both environmental and financial concerns that resonate with modern consumers.",

Then I decided that it would be better to educate people in a way that will make them better prompters instead of copy-pasting, and even better - learn new topics along the way. This is where the idea of creating a gamified website came about. I wanted to have an engaging experience while the user is trying to prompt his way out of a debate which will purposefully reward him with new knowledge in a certain category.",

      "description": "Inspiration When I started prepping for the TEF Canada exam, most resources felt lifeless and disconnected and didn’t reflect the actual test. I kept thinking, Why isn’t there something that just feels like the real exam? After extensive research I found out that there is no such product out there. So we built it.  What It Does Over a single weekend using bolt.new, we prototyped a TEF Canada prep platform that actually feels like the real thing. It’s a full-scope practice hub powered by AI, covering reading, listening, writing, and speaking—plus real-time feedback and progress tracking that actually helps.  Reading & Listening: Realistic practice in the style and timing of the official exam Writing & Speaking: Instantly evaluated by AI, mapped to CLB levels Progress Dashboard: See what’s working, fix what’s not, and stay motivated with visual milestones How We Built It Bolt-Powered Sprint: We used bolt.new to move fast frontend, backend, and AI evaluation all spun up in one platform Exam Reverse Engineering: We mapped out the TEF structure by breaking down every section type and scoring rubric AI Scoring: LLM handles writing and speaking tasks by evaluating clarity and structure. Challenges We Hit Authenticity Without Infringement: We recreated the TEF vibe without stepping on any official content toes Keeping It Engaging: TEF prep can be dry, so we layered in fun UI and timed challenges to keep things fresh What We’re Proud Of Built a full TEF simulation in a weekend Created CLB-aligned scoring that holds up against certified raters Let learners test drive all four skills without any paywall pressure What We Learned Targeted Practice Wins: Personalized feedback moves the needle faster than one-size-fits-all drills AI + Human = Gold Standard: Even smart models need human oversight to stay sharp Fun > Friction: Progress tracking and gamification make a huge difference in long prep cycles What’s Next Feature to buy credits: People can buy credits.

I wanted to build a platform that truly bridges this gap, making healthcare more accessible, efficient, and community-driven.  Who is it for?  Synclinic is built for both patients and doctors.  Patients benefit from instant access to an AI-powered medical assistant, Agatha Christine, who provides personalized health tips, preliminary assessments, and support 24/7.  Doctors get a secure, intuitive dashboard to manage patient records, send prescriptions, update health information, and communicate easily—all while maintaining the highest standards of privacy.  Key Features & Integrations:  AI Assistant (Agatha Christine): Doctors can train and update the AI for improved and safe analysis. Patients get tailored recommendations and fast answers.  Community Experience: Patients can share their health journeys, support each other, and learn from collective experiences—vital in countries where hospitals are scarce.  Doctor & Patient Dashboards: Secure record-keeping, real-time messaging, appointment management, and more.  Pandemic-ready: Enables remote triage, care, and support during health crises.  Integrations: Built on Supabase for secure storage & authentication, OpenAI for smart AI chat, and ElevenLabs for natural voice interactions.",
