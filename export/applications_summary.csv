3024,AI Resume Matcher,"Last month, a friend of mine called me sounding defeated. He‚Äôd been applying to dozens of jobs, sending out resume after resume, and wasn‚Äôt getting a single callback. ‚ÄúI just wish I knew what I‚Äôm doing wrong,‚Äù he said. That one line hit me ‚Äî because I‚Äôve worked in the HR space for years, and I‚Äôve seen this happen from the other side too.  The truth is, most job applications never even make it to a recruiter. Around 78% of resumes get filtered out by software ‚Äî the ATS systems companies use to scan and shortlist candidates. Good people often get ignored simply because their resume doesn‚Äôt match the exact keywords or format the system is looking for. They‚Äôre not rejected for lack of talent ‚Äî they‚Äôre just lost in translation.  That‚Äôs when it clicked. With my experience in HR, I know how the backend works. I‚Äôve seen how systems scan resumes, what recruiters look for, and where candidates often go wrong. So I thought ‚Äî why not turn that insight into something useful for job seekers? Why not build a solution that gives people real feedback, based on how these systems actually work?  That‚Äôs how AI Resume Matcher was born. It‚Äôs a simple tool that helps job seekers stop guessing and start applying smarter. You just upload your resume, paste the job description (or job link), and get an instant match score. It shows you what you‚Äôre missing, what you‚Äôve done right, and exactly how to improve. If you need help fixing it, the AI can even generate improved resume content or a tailored cover letter on the spot.  This isn‚Äôt just another resume builder. It‚Äôs built from real HR experience, powered by smart AI, and designed to give job seekers the edge they need. Whether you're switching careers, just starting out, or trying to land that dream job ‚Äî this tool makes the process feel more in your control.  Instead of applying to 50 jobs and hearing nothing, people can now send 10 well-optimized resumes and actually get results.

That left many talented people without access to basic tools they needed.  We asked ourselves ,what if creativity didn‚Äôt depend on any of that? What if someone could edit videos, compress images, test APIs, write code, convert files, or create documents, all in the browser, completely offline?  That‚Äôs what inspired EditForge Pro ‚Äî an all-in-one creative and developer suite designed to run entirely in the browser, with zero setup, zero sign-up, and complete privacy.  What it does EditForge Pro is a browser-based suite of over 25 tools that work completely offline. It covers a wide range of needs:  For creatives: video, audio, image editors, PDF tools, quote generators, and more  For developers: code editor, API tester, JSON formatter, hash and password tools  For students and researchers: text editor, lyrics finder, Wikipedia search  For everyday users: file converters, QR and calendar generators, screen recorder, unit converter, and more  All tools are designed to work without relying on APIs, external services, or user accounts. Everything runs locally, offering privacy and reliability.  How we built it EditForge Pro was developed using:  HTML, CSS (with Tailwind) for the user interface  Vanilla JavaScript modules for logic and tool isolation  Vite.js as the bundler and development environment  IndexedDB and LocalStorage to store preferences and process files locally  Service Workers for offline-first behavior  Netlify for free and fast global deployment  Each tool was built modularly, allowing them to work independently while sharing a consistent design and experience.

While the world faced crisis after crisis‚Äîfrom the unrest in Manipur to global tragedies‚Äîthere was no platform that truly captured the emotional state of the world.

What makes it special?  Symbione maps global news into a 3D emotional space using AI, sentiment analysis, and data from platforms like Reddit, grouped by emotions like joy, fear, anger, and hope. It‚Äôs not just a feed; it‚Äôs a visual, emotional landscape. Users can explore stories, save them to the Cosmark (an AI-powered research space), and interact with an emotional assistant for deeper understanding.  Symbione is for the emotionally curious, the thinkers, the feelers, the ones seeking connection in a disconnected world.",https://bolt.new/~/github-e3u6rkmo,Bolt,2025-09-18T11:21:54.068283,2025-09-18T11:21:54.068283
