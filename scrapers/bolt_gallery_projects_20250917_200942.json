      "description": "What problem does it solve, or what inspired you to build it? I built Creldesk because freelancers often waste time jumping between multiple tools for editing, creating proposals, building resumes, managing invoices, and handling small productivity tasks. Instead of opening five different websites, I wanted to create an all-in-one workdesk that puts everything in one place. The inspiration came from the everyday struggles of freelancers who need speed, organization, and reliability to get client work done efficiently.  Who is it for? Creldesk is designed for freelancers, remote workers, and students who need a clean, professional, and centralized dashboard for their daily tasks. Whether someone is editing visuals, writing proposals, or managing documents, Creldesk provides the essential tools in one platform.  Key Features & Functionality  Editors: Embedded Photopea editor, functional Logo Editor (with export options), Resume Builder (PDF export, AI-generated sections), Proposal Generator, and Invoice Generator.  Productivity Tools: PDF Compressor, Screen Recorder, File Converter (images and documents), and Audio Visualizer.  Utilities: QR Code Generator, Password Generator, Color Picker, and Pomodoro Timer.  Design & Usability:  Professional Apple-style dark mode UI with turquoise accents  Collapsible sidebar with categories (Editors, Productivity, Tools)  Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile  Fully functional tools (no placeholders)  Integrations: Uses iframes for embedded apps like Photopea, and custom-coded JavaScript/Tailwind for built-in tools such as the resume builder, logo editor, and file utilities.",

What makes IDMind unique is its ability to turn raw detection outputs into human-readable fraud reports using an integrated Large Language Model (LLM). This means compliance teams get clear, explainable reasons behind a “pass” or “flag” decision — not just raw scores.

My mom was a childcare assistant, and I had the chance to see dozens of little budding artists with their drawings, stories, and dreams. But these treasures often faded away over time. One day, I wondered: \"What if I could bring these childhood memories to life?\" Doodibook was born from this deep desire to capture children’s imagination, showcase their creations, and offer them an eternal keepsake to share.  What it does Doodibook is a magical web application that transforms children’s drawings into enchanting stories and illustrations. Users can create:  The Magic Book: a personalized book, chapter by chapter, enriched with automatically generated illustrations.  The Magic Card: a shorter format, a card with a magical drawing on the front and a tender story on the back.

      "description": "Hey! So I'm Lakshya, just turned 18 and still figuring out this whole \"adulting\" thing while finishing high school. Got obsessed with AI after falling down way too many YouTube rabbit holes (probably should've been studying lol). The Problem That Drove Me Crazy: I really wanted to start something with AI - like, I had all these ideas but every single tool I looked at was either $200+ per month or required me to basically become a programmer overnight. I'm decent with computers but come on, I'm not trying to spend 6 months learning Python just to build a simple chatbot. It felt like being the only person without a driver's license trying to get somewhere. What I Built: AutoBoss is basically what I wished existed when I started - a no-code way for regular people to create AI stuff and actually make money from it. Think of it as training wheels for starting an AI agency, but the training wheels actually work really well. Who It's For: Anyone who's curious about AI but doesn't want to become a developer. I'm thinking freelancers who want to add AI services, small business owners, people in their 20s-40s who are tech-curious but not tech-experts. Basically people like my mom who can use Canva but would run away screaming from GitHub. What It Actually Does:  Client Workspaces - keeps your projects organized instead of having 47 browser tabs open AI Employee Builder - you can make chatbots or data analysis tools (added some badges because why not make it fun?) Document Training - upload PDFs or paste website URLs to teach your AI stuff Easy Sharing - send clients their AI tools through simple links  I built it mostly with Bolt.new (which is amazing btw), Firebase for the backend stuff, and Next.js. Did most of the coding between 11pm-2am because that's when my brain actually works. The Cool Part: In June, I got some people to test it and they were building working AI solutions in like 10-15 minutes. One person made a chatbot for a local bakery that actually helped them res",

We wanted to build something better. A system that makes personal growth feel like leveling up your character, not checking off chores.  Most people already know what they should do. Go to the gym. Save money. Stay focused. But knowing isn’t the problem. The real struggle is staying consistent without structure, feedback, or a sense of momentum.  Awaken turns self-development into an RPG.  It gives each user daily AI-generated quests based on their goals across fitness, wealth, mindset, and relationships. Completing quests earns EXP, levels up their anime-style avatar, and drives real-world growth. Avatars are generated from selfies and evolve as the user does.  Core features include quest streaks, ranking systems, guilds, and optional social media locks for missed goals. Every detail is designed to feel like story-driven progress — not just productivity.  Who it’s for: Ambitious young adults who want more from life but are tired of generic advice. Especially men aged 16 to 33 who grew up immersed in anime, gaming, and online culture. They don’t want a boring checklist. They want a system that speaks their language.  Awaken is not just another app. It is an identity builder, a discipline engine, and a culture in the making. We are reimagining what it means to grow.",

      "description": "I wanted to explore whether a simple interactive experience could leave a lasting emotional impact. We’re constantly surrounded by statistics about war, climate change, and social issues, but they often feel distant or abstract. I wondered—what if we could sneak that awareness in through something unexpected?  Impact Taps looks like a game at first. You tap for 10 seconds, thinking it's about speed or reflexes. But when the timer ends, you’re shown your score as a real-world statistic—like the number of children killed in conflict zones last year, or the amount of plastic dumped into the ocean every day. The surprise makes people stop and think. That’s the goal.  This was built entirely using one prompt on Bolt.new. The app uses JavaScript to track taps, a 10-second timer, and a simple local JSON file filled with verified statistics. No backend, no fancy logic. Just a clean interface and one strong emotional reveal.  Impact Taps is for anyone who scrolls the web mindlessly and needs a moment of perspective. It’s quick, frictionless, and designed to catch people off guard—in a good way.",

Crafting the perfect prompt often requires multiple iterations, and generic prompts typically focus only on basic elements like the subject and environment while ignoring critical cinematic aspects such as camera angles, shot types, lighting, and visual effects.  As video generation becomes more mainstream, creators need a smarter way to build rich and detailed prompts that translate into visually compelling results.   I took a cinematic scene and reverse-engineered it, breaking it down into key components:  Character & Action – including Age, Subject, Emotion, and Activity. Environment & Atmosphere – such as Location, Time of Day, and Mood. Cinematic Details – like Camera Shot Type, Movement, and Angle. Visuals & Tone – covering Lighting, Aesthetics, VFX, Color Palette, Audio, and Resolution. Dialogue – for adding spoken elements.  By filling in these guided inputs, you’re essentially crafting a complete cinematic scene—one that’s ready to be copied directly into AI video generation platforms for high-quality output.",

Inspired by my own experience raising two young kids, I noticed that stories helped my older child process big emotions better than lectures — but finding the right story in the moment wasn’t always easy.  Mamabase solves this by taking a real-life parenting situation (like sibling jealousy or tantrums) and generating a personalized, age-appropriate story — complete with a teaching moment and a printable illustration — to help children understand and cope.  Built for busy parents, Mamabase features:  A warm AI agent that reflects back emotional insight  A customizable “StoryCoach” experience with user-selected style and tone  Integration with OpenAI (via Bolt) and Supabase (auth & storage)  Example prompt from the user: “My 4-year-old melts down when it’s time to leave the park.”  Mamabase replies with emotional reflection, parenting support, and a unique story to share with the child — all in under a minute.",

Three years and many mentorship conversations later, I realized this is still the norm — especially in fast-paced startups.  Ramp brings structure to those chaotic first weeks. It gives you:  A tailored 3-week onboarding checklist  A real-world “Ask a PM” AI assistant  A library of ready-to-use templates  I built Ramp in a single AI prompt using Bolt, styled with TailwindCSS and powered by GPT-4o logic (coming).

What makes it special?  Symbione maps global news into a 3D emotional space using AI, sentiment analysis, and data from platforms like Reddit, grouped by emotions like joy, fear, anger, and hope. It’s not just a feed; it’s a visual, emotional landscape. Users can explore stories, save them to the Cosmark (an AI-powered research space), and interact with an emotional assistant for deeper understanding.

Wheely solves this by offering an all-in-one platform where users can rent bicycles, scooters, motorbikes, and cars on an hourly basis. Designed for tourists, students, gig workers, and daily commuters, it allows users to browse nearby vehicles, select rental duration, and return them at designated drop zones. The app is built using React Native with Expo Router for seamless navigation, Lucide Icons for a clean UI, and Django Rest Framework on the backend. Key features include dynamic ride selection, intuitive modals, multi-language support, and a responsive UI for both Android and iOS. We also designed the system to be scalable—ready for future integrations like GPS tracking, payments, referral programs, and even a unique Subletting feature where users can share unused rental time with others. With Wheely, we’re redefining short-term transportation as smarter, more flexible, and community-driven.",

PurpleVerse was inspired by the frustrating limitations people in low-income countries face when shopping online — especially when it comes to international payments, FOREX instability, and platform restrictions. Traditional e-commerce is often inaccessible or expensive for users in these regions, and that creates a digital divide in global trade.  I wanted to solve this by creating a borderless e-commerce platform that leverages crypto (USDC on Algorand Testnet for the prototype) as the means of payment. This removes the need for traditional financial systems and enables secure, trustless transactions worldwide — even for physical goods.  PurpleVerse is for:  Buyers who want to shop globally without payment restrictions.  Sellers looking to reach wider markets and access intelligent tools.  Emerging markets underserved by mainstream payment systems.   🔑 Key Features & Functionality  Crypto-Powered Payments Secure, escrow-based crypto transactions using USDC on Algorand. Funds are held until buyers confirm delivery.  Mock Wallet Integration For demo purposes, a hardcoded mock wallet simulates crypto payments and release flows.  AI-Assisted Seller Tools Sellers get help writing product descriptions, tracking analytics, and managing inventory through AI-powered features.  Admin Dashboard Full control panel to manage users, roles, featured products, commissions, and blog content.  Flash Sales & Featured Listings Sellers can run time-limited offers or pay to boost product visibility across the platform.  Platform Revenue Model 5% commission on every sale + featured product placement fees, all automated.  Blog and AI Chatbot (Support) Includes a built-in blog CMS and AI chatbot to assist buyers and sellers with FAQs and navigation.   🔌 Built With:  Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vite  Backend: Supabase (auth, DB, storage, functions, RLS)  Blockchain: Algorand (Testnet) using algo",

Then I decided that it would be better to educate people in a way that will make them better prompters instead of copy-pasting, and even better - learn new topics along the way. This is where the idea of creating a gamified website came about.

We wanted to build a platform that not only helps users find jobs but also helps them become the best candidates they can be, specifically addressing the unique challenges faced by job seekers in the South African context. What it does: AI-powered CV Generation; Interview Coaching with Real-time Feedback; Personalised Job Matching; Career Readiness Scoring",

My mom was a childcare assistant, and I had the chance to see dozens of little budding artists with their drawings, stories, and dreams. But these treasures often faded away over time. One day, I wondered: \"What if I could bring these childhood memories to life?\" Doodibook was born from this deep desire to capture children’s imagination, showcase their creations, and offer them an eternal keepsake to share.  What it does Doodibook is a magical web application that transforms children’s drawings into enchanting stories and illustrations. Users can create:  The Magic Book: a personalized book, chapter by chapter, enriched with automatically generated illustrations.  The Magic Card: a shorter format, a card with a magical drawing on the front and a tender story on the back.  The Lenticular Card: a card that changes image depending on the viewing angle, revealing magic before your eyes.

      "description": "Wet Noses Saranda is a nonprofit platform built to help stray dogs in Saranda, Albania find loving homes. It connects rescued dogs with potential adopters, shares success stories, and allows the community to report new strays that need help. While visiting my hometown in Albania to spend time with my family and work remotely, I decided one evening to take a solo walk along the city boulevard. That’s when I came across a small stand with three adorable puppies and a sign about Wet Noses Saranda, an initiative started by a local woman named Kristi to rescue and rehome stray dogs.  As a dog lover, I immediately felt a connection. After reading about their work, I knew I wanted to help. As a software engineer, I offered to build them a website even though I had limited free time.",

The burden was always on them to adapt, and that didn’t sit right with me. I wanted to flip that script and build a bridge, which is why I created BRYGE AI. It’s an AI-powered communication assistant for any neurotypical person—a manager, a friend, or a partner—who wants to connect more thoughtfully and effectively with the ADHD minds in their life. It goes far beyond grammar checkers to fundamentally reshape how a message is crafted and emotionally received. First, it acts as a personal coach, intelligently analyzing your original message for hidden pressure words and emotional triggers. Then, it transforms dense text into clean, emotionally safer language that you can customize with different tones and intents. Its standout feature, powered by ElevenLabs, is the ability to generate a personalized voice note in your own voice, which lowers the cognitive load for the recipient and eliminates the cold, robotic feel of other AI tools. Ultimately, BRYGE AI doesn’t just fix one message—it teaches you how to communicate better, helping you build the lasting habits of clarity, kindness, and emotional intelligence that reshape all your relationships.",

It's built for communities, enabling them to send, receive, and verify critical alerts without relying on central servers.  Key Features: - A full-stack application with a live Supabase backend for real-time alerts. - A multi-page dashboard for threat monitoring and reporting. - A community-based verification system to combat misinformation. - A \"Trusted Circle\" interface for personal network management.  The entire project, from concept and UI design to the full-stack integration, was built in under 72 hours through an intensive human-AI collaboration using Bolt.new, Gemini, and other AI tools.",

Traditional tours are expensive and inflexible, operating on rigid schedules that don't accommodate spontaneous exploration. Our solution is an SMS-based scavenger hunt that guides users through urban street art discoveries. The platform uses Twilio for text messaging interactions and Supabase for secure authentication. Users explore cities through graffiti pieces and locations stored in our database, unlocking new experiences at their own pace. We're building organic reach through automatically generated blog content based on our cataloged street art and partnerships. Our partnership pages are already ranking well in Google searches, creating a sustainable growth channel. The platform is fully monetized with Stripe integration for seamless payments. The concept was inspired by a personal experience exploring historic buildings in London, but evolved to focus specifically on street art to create a more vibrant, contemporary urban adventure.",

Problema que resuelve / Inspiración En Argentina existen muy pocos recursos accesibles para quienes quieren iniciarse en el mundo del cuarto de milla: la información está dispersa en foros, videos y manuales en inglés, sin un recorrido pedagógico que guíe paso a paso a principiantes. Me inspiró mi propia experiencia como corredor aficionado y la pasión de la comunidad local, para condensar todo en un sólo manual claro y práctico.  Público objetivo – Aficionados y entusiastas del drag racing que recién comienzan. – Pilotos de calle y clubes de automóviles que quieran profesionalizar su preparación. – Talleres y preparadores que busquen una guía básica de referencia.  Características clave  Historia y contexto local: evolución del cuarto de milla en pistas argentinas, anécdotas y referencias a eventos destacados.  Guías prácticas: desde la elección del vehículo y sus componentes (suspensión, neumáticos, transmisión) hasta ajustes básicos de motor e inyección.  Electrónica aplicada: conceptos de mapas de ECU, uso de sensores (TPS, RPM, temperatura), y ejemplos de configuración semisecuencial.  Técnicas de conducción: staging, launch control, manejo de la tracción y los cambios para optimizar el crono.  Seguridad y normativa: checklist de equipamiento obligatorio, permisos y reglamentos de pista.  Recursos adicionales: plantillas de registro de tiempos, códigos QR a tutoriales en video y enlaces a proveedores argentinos.",

      "description": "The Nokia 3310 from the early 2000s was my first taste of mobile gaming. I spent dozens of hours playing Snake on my father’s phone. I wanted to recreate that feeling in a single prompt for the Oneshot Challenge. Building the basic Snake game was the easy part, the real challenge was designing the layout and pixel font to match the retro style, all within a single prompt and without needing follow-ups. I’d like to add that, although I work as a project manager, I have very limited hands-on experience with programming and Bolt honestly feels like magic.  I'll gladly share the prompt via DM on X (https://x.com/kolar_eth)  What it does Recreates Snake on an 84 × 48 grid of 8 px divs Arrow keys/WASD + space-to-start Authentic LCD “jitter” (0.5 px gaps) Retro beeps (Web Audio API) Score rendered in a 5 × 5 pixel font outside the grid How I built it React + TypeScript inside Bolt.new Tailwind CSS grid utilities only—no <canvas> Game loop via setInterval, food blink via requestAnimationFrame Modular components: GameGrid.tsx, ScoreDisplay.tsx, Overlay.tsx Challenges Keeping pixel gaps intact after CSS transforms Syncing score font with un-scaled grid pixels Accomplishments Zero images/SVG—100 % div-driven graphics",

The SATA app is built to change that.

Built with React/Vite, Supabase (auth, row-level security, storage), Recharts/Tailwind for visuals, and Netlify for zero-ops deployment, MoldMend turns a confusing, multi-month healing journey into clear, data-driven steps—helping sufferers breathe easier, regain energy, and reclaim their lives.",

      "description": "Inspiration As students, we often find ourselves distracted while studying — especially when switching between our e-materials, YouTube, and AI tools. A simple task like understanding a concept quickly becomes a rabbit hole of distractions.  We wanted a solution that lets students upload their study material and stay locked in — learning, asking AI questions, and watching only the right videos — all in one focused space. That’s how SuperArc was born:  An AI-powered, distraction-free study platform that helps students focus deeply and build their comeback arc.  What it does SuperArc is a productivity-first platform designed for students and self-learners. It lets users:  Upload PDFs, notes, or any study materials Use AI to ask questions contextually based on their material Get YouTube video suggestions relevant to the topic they're reading Summarize long content instantly Auto-generate flashcards after each topic Study in Pomodoro mode with streak tracking and gamified progress Unlock badges like \"Ignition\" and \"Locked In\" based on study discipline All of this happens within a dark-mode, focused workspace — built to help users stay in the zone.  How we built it We designed and built the UI with:  React.js for the front end ShadCN for clean, modern UI components Supabase for authentication and file storage Gemini API for contextual AI chat, summaries, and topic detection YouTube Data API for fetching educational videos based on extracted content We also built modular sections:  A reading pane for uploaded materials AI assistant chat Flashcard tab Video suggestion tab A focus timer with built-in badge reward logic Challenges we ran into Accurately extracting readable text from PDF documents in various formats Making AI responses strictly context-aware (based on the uploaded material only) Suggesting YouTube videos that are actually relevant and educational — not just clickbait Designing the experience to feel motivational but not overwhelming Accomplishments that we're",

      "description": "As someone who works full-time and loves staying up to date with AI research, I found it nearly impossible to keep up with all the new papers coming out. Most papers are dense, and YouTube explainers are long and time-consuming. I wanted something that would let me learn while doing other things—whether I'm walking, commuting, or at the gym.  That’s what inspired me to build AI Snax. It’s designed for busy professionals, curious learners, students, and even AI enthusiasts who want to stay sharp without having to carve out focused reading time. The app delivers short, 2–3 minute audio podcasts that break down recent AI papers into digestible bites.  Users can scroll through podcast cards, listen on the go, save favorites, and even view the original paper on arXiv if they want to dive deeper. On the backend, I integrated ElevenLabs to generate high-quality voice narration, Supabase for authentication and user profiles, and Netlify for seamless deployment. Admin users can upload transcripts or trigger podcast generation with just a few clicks.

      "description": "In 2020, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, I saw how many people silently struggled — needing help but unable or afraid to ask for it. Meanwhile, others wanted to help but had no idea who needed support or where to go.  That’s when the idea for Open Letter Map was born — a way to put help requests on a map so responders could act fast. In 2025, I brought this vision to life and reimagined it as Open World Map – Call for Heroes for the Bolt.new hackathon. Open World Map is a real-time, location-based social platform where:      Civilians can issue help requests or report local issues.     Heroes (volunteers or skilled individuals) can respond based on their abilities and proximity.     Organizations can coordinate support at scale.  Core features:      Drop issue markers on the map     Request or offer help with optional visibility     Like, comment, and chat on issues and updates     Post statuses and mission logs like a social feed     View hero profiles with skills, missions, and reputation",

Polylogue solves this by delivering contextualized, level-appropriate stories and animations, supported by images, gestures, and native audio — just like how we naturally acquire language.  Inspired by both research in language acquisition and the lack of quality content for many underserved languages, Polylogue is built for learners of all levels, and especially for those passionate about preserving and using less-resourced languages.

      "description": "Recruitment in Bangladesh is so flawed that the students of my country had to overthrow the government in an attempt to reform it.  Entry-level jobs ask for 2-3 years of “work experience”, have sky-high credential requirements (which are often unrelated to the job) and the interview process often lasts for months on end. Moreover, recruiters often favor those from more prestigious Universities or those with referrals.  Employers are always complaining about “not finding talent with the right practical skills” but skilled job seekers in Bangladesh are often overlooked due to the above reasons.  LaunchPad connects employers to skilled talent and skilled talent to opportunities that they have long been deprived of.  Here’s how:  Employers post the job description and a short task that is related to the job, such as making a to-do app for an app development job. Instead of just putting in a resume, the candidate has to finish the task and upload it along with their skill portfolio.  This way, employers can directly evaluate the candidate’s practical skills without any bias. Additionally, this ensures only those with the relevant skills can apply, which means candidates don’t get their application buried by thousands of irrelevant people spamming their resumes on every job. Another problem is that many graduates don’t even know what practical skills they would need for their dream job. To solve this, we used ChatGPT-3.5-turbo API integration to analyse the user’s skill level and job target to build a custom roadmap with skill-building challenges to help them build up their skills & portfolio. We’re not just a job posting site, we’re the leaders of a movement to make hiring fair for all.",

This app is for families, friends, and loved ones of U.S. veterans — as well as community groups and organizations that want to celebrate those who served. It’s designed to be welcoming and easy to use, even for people with little technical experience.  Key features include:  A guided form to create a personalized tribute  Dedicated tribute pages styled by military branch (Army, Navy, etc.)  Ability to upload photos, write a message, and list medals or achievements  A public Wall of Honor to browse and celebrate all shared tributes  Option to feature a tribute with a donation  Built with Supabase (database, auth) and Netlify (hosting) for speed and scalability",

      "description": "A woman’s monthly cycle has phases that affect her mood, energy, and stress levels. CycleWise gives husbands gentle alerts and simple guidance on when and how to show the support that truly matters. I have observed how the understanding, or misunderstanding, of emotions between spouses can make or break the peace in a home. In many cases, I saw how domestic tension, even violence against women, often stemmed from emotional misinterpretation.  This got me asking the question: \"What if men knew more about the emotions of their wives?\" I began researching how much men knew about the emotional cycles of women. I interviewed some married men and asked the question \"Are you aware that your wife’s monthly cycle influences her emotions and behavior?\" Over 98% had no idea. They were often shocked and remorseful. A common reaction was: “If I had known this earlier, I would have been more patient and supportive.”  This became my initial inspiration to build an app that gives husbands the insight to understand and support the emotional health of their wives. The next inspiration was their willingness to pay a token for monthly subscription (one responder promised to donate to the product), and the final inspiration is that the tools to easily build it was made available by Bolt's hackathon. What it does  CycleWise gives husbands the insight to understand and support the emotional health of their wives. It uses the cycle start date to calculate the emotionally sensitive phase, and sends monthly alert and support tips, a day before it starts. I believe it can improve marriage relationships and help to build more peaceful homes. How we built it  I interviewed 8 married men in an effort to validate the idea, and got them on the wait-list. Bolt.New was used to build all core functionalities till it was production-ready with: Payment processing (Paystack for Nigeria, Stripe for international) Supabase integration with payment status tracking Beautiful, responsive design Email collect",

      "description": "This project, \"HealthCostBenefit - Evidence-Based Supplement Analysis,\" is designed to help individuals make informed decisions about dietary supplements by providing a data-driven approach to evaluating their cost-effectiveness.  The core problem it solves is the lack of clear, evidence-based information regarding the true value and return on investment (ROI) of various supplements. Many consumers purchase supplements without understanding their potential health benefits in quantifiable terms or their economic impact. This platform aims to bridge that gap by applying principles of health economics, specifically Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), to supplement analysis.  It is primarily for health-conscious individuals, researchers, and anyone looking to understand the scientific and economic rationale behind supplement use.  Key features and functionality include:  AI-Powered Database Expansion: The application leverages AI to automatically research, validate, and populate a comprehensive database of supplements. This involves integrating with external APIs like PubMed for scientific literature, RapidAPI for real-time pricing data, and OpenAI for synthesizing complex information into understandable supplement profiles. It also includes robust validation and cleanup mechanisms to ensure data quality.

It aims to provide health guidance that understands and respects an individual's cultural background, food traditions, and lifestyle preferences.  The problem NutureAI solves is the inadequacy of generic health advice and technology for diverse populations. Many existing health applications recommend approaches that don't align with the cultural practices or traditional healing foods of various communities. This leads to a disconnect where health technology fails to serve the full spectrum of how people live, eat, and find joy in movement.  NutureAI's solution is to offer personalized coaching that learns an individual's life, not just their data, by considering their schedule, preferences, family dynamics, and cultural context. It also fosters community connection, creating a \"cultural health village\" where users can connect with others who share their background and health journey. The core mission is to ensure that every person receives health guidance that celebrates their culture, rather than erasing it. NutureAI offers three key benefits:  Cultural Adaptation: It honors your food heritage by using AI that understands traditional foods, cooking methods, and cultural health practices from your background. Personalized Coaching: It learns your life, not just data, through adaptive coaching that considers your schedule, preferences, family dynamics, and cultural context. Community Connection: It provides a cultural health village where you can connect with others who share your cultural background and health journey for support and accountability.",

      "description": "As someone navigating careers in both Cybersecurity and Web Development, I quickly realized just how frustrating it was to constantly tweak and tailor my resume for different roles. One week I’d be applying for a SOC analyst role, and the next, a web app developer position, and each time, I had to reformat, rewrite, and rephrase my CV from scratch.  I’d often find myself wondering:  Didn’t I already write a better version of this somewhere?  Which version did I use for that last successful interview?  How do I make sure my resume passes those annoying ATS systems?  It was overwhelming, not because I didn’t have the experience, but because I didn’t have a system.  That’s when it hit me: why not build the system myself?  CVStore was born out of this pain point. I wanted a tool that could:  Store my professional profile once.  Let AI handle the resume generation, whether for cybersecurity, development, or something new.  Keep track of every version I created so I could reuse or update them later.  Optimize each resume for real-world ATS systems, not just templates that “look nice.”  I didn’t just build it for myself, I built it for every multi-skilled professional, freelancer, or job-switcher who’s tired of redoing the same work over and over. CVStore is my way of turning my own challenge into a powerful, time-saving solution for others.",

I built it because nobody really talks about the environmental cost of AI and I wanted a way to track my usage without guilt-tripping myself. It’s for builders, researchers, and curious folks who want visibility into their AI habits and a nudge toward mindful prompting. Powered by Bolt and Supabase.

It was inspired by the observation that traditional trackers can be discouraging, especially for children and individuals facing developmental or physical challenges. When a user misses a day, many apps highlight the failure, creating shame and making it hard to continue.  GlowMyState solves this problem by creating an emotionally safe space. Instead of rigid checkmarks, users interact with delightful, floating bubbles to log their progress or consciously skip a day without any penalty. This removes the pressure and makes trying again feel natural and rewarding.  Designed for inclusivity, GlowMyState is perfect for children, neurodiverse users, and any adult seeking a softer, more mindful approach to personal growth. Key features include:    Rich customization with over 10 colors and icons to express each day uniquely.  Separate Child & Parent Modes, secured by a PIN for safe and gentle supervision.  Optional memos for reflection, gratitude, or journaling.  A simple, touch-friendly interface with an animated onboarding flow that requires no complex tutorials.  An optional AI Report that offers gentle encouragement by focusing on positive trends.  Ultimately, GlowMyState empowers users to feel proud of their unique journey and find a tracking style that feels truly their own.",

I ran a quick analysis, built her a routine, and she tried it. And it worked.  She said, “You have to make this into an app. People need this.”  That’s how SmartHair started. It wasn’t about building a business. It was about helping her. It still is.  What it does SmartHair gives you a routine that actually works. You take a photo. You answer one question. That’s it. The app reads your hair and gives you real guidance based on what you actually need.  It’s not about selling products. It’s not a funnel. It doesn’t ask for fifteen minutes of your time. It respects you.  This is for people who are tired of being talked down to. Who don’t want another trendy serum. Who just want to understand their hair and take care of it.",

      "description": "Small businesses and second-hand sellers often struggle to gain visibility online without paid ads, SEO expertise, or influencer reach. At the same time, nearby buyers don’t realize these sellers exist—even when they offer exactly what they need. NearCart solves this by creating a bridge between undiscovered sellers and local buyers, using real-time location intelligence. This project was inspired by the need to make local commerce truly discoverable—not through algorithms or marketing, but through simple proximity. It’s about turning communities into living marketplaces and giving solo sellers a fair shot at success. NearCart is built for small businesses and startups that struggle to get noticed online, second-hand or individual sellers who want to connect with nearby customers, consumers seeking instant access to local products, and communities that care about shopping sustainably and supporting their neighborhood economy. It’s designed to empower the overlooked, simplify discovery, and strengthen local connections all through the power of proximity. NearCart offers a seamless, hyperlocal shopping experience with features like real-time product search to instantly connect users with nearby sellers, interactive store listings that display distance, prices, and product visuals, and built-in navigation using Google Maps for smooth routing. Even without a specific search, users can browse nearby shops through a discovery mode that acts like a live marketplace map. The app integrates essential APIs for location tracking and inventory access, includes secure authentication with external providers, and was built completely via AI prompt engineering using Bolt AI without writing a single line of traditional code.",

It was inspired by our own struggles—constantly juggling multiple insurance documents, reminders, and logins across different platforms like Google Sheets, WhatsApp chats with agents, and email threads. We realized there was no central, user-friendly tool built specifically for families to stay organized and secure with their policies.  This app is for anyone managing multiple insurance policies—whether for themselves, parents, spouses, or children—across life, health, vehicle, and other types of insurance.  🔑 Key Features: Dashboard to view all active policies  Family member-based organization  Policy reminders (renewal, premium dates, maturity, etc.)  Cloud-based access for safe storage  Filter and search by policy type, company, or member  Mobile-friendly interface  The goal: No more missed premiums, no lost documents, and no confusion—just peace of mind and better control over your family’s insurance.",

      "description": "The idea for SpeakDude came from a deeply personal struggle that millions of language learners face every day. Like many others, I wanted to become fluent in English, but I found myself constantly stumbling over words, hesitating mid-sentence, and making embarrassing mistakes. The fear of being judged by others was so overwhelming that I often chose silence over speaking, which only made my fluency worse.  I realized that traditional language learning apps focus heavily on grammar rules and vocabulary memorization, but they completely miss the most crucial skill: actually speaking. You can know thousands of words and perfect grammar, but if you can't speak confidently in real conversations, you're not truly fluent.  The breakthrough moment came when I understood that what language learners really need is a judgment-free practice partner - someone who won't laugh at mistakes, won't get impatient with stuttering, and is available 24/7 to practice with.

      "description": "Inspiration: Growing up in Rwanda and working closely with students, cyber cafés, and self-taught developers, I noticed a common limitation: most creative and developer tools require constant internet access, subscriptions, or powerful devices. That left many talented people without access to basic tools they needed.  We asked ourselves ,what if creativity didn’t depend on any of that? What if someone could edit videos, compress images, test APIs, write code, convert files, or create documents, all in the browser, completely offline?  That’s what inspired EditForge Pro — an all-in-one creative and developer suite designed to run entirely in the browser, with zero setup, zero sign-up, and complete privacy.  What it does EditForge Pro is a browser-based suite of over 25 tools that work completely offline. It covers a wide range of needs:  For creatives: video, audio, image editors, PDF tools, quote generators, and more  For developers: code editor, API tester, JSON formatter, hash and password tools  For students and researchers: text editor, lyrics finder, Wikipedia search  For everyday users: file converters, QR and calendar generators, screen recorder, unit converter, and more  All tools are designed to work without relying on APIs, external services, or user accounts. Everything runs locally, offering privacy and reliability.  How we built it EditForge Pro was developed using:  HTML, CSS (with Tailwind) for the user interface  Vanilla JavaScript modules for logic and tool isolation  Vite.js as the bundler and development environment  IndexedDB and LocalStorage to store preferences and process files locally  Service Workers for offline-first behavior  Netlify for free and fast global deployment  Each tool was built modularly, allowing them to work independently while sharing a consistent design and experience.  Challenges we ran into One of the biggest challenges was building offline-first tools that typically rely on APIs or cloud infrastructure. Features like Wik",

      "description": "Last month, a friend of mine called me sounding defeated. He’d been applying to dozens of jobs, sending out resume after resume, and wasn’t getting a single callback. “I just wish I knew what I’m doing wrong,” he said. That one line hit me — because I’ve worked in the HR space for years, and I’ve seen this happen from the other side too.  The truth is, most job applications never even make it to a recruiter. Around 78% of resumes get filtered out by software — the ATS systems companies use to scan and shortlist candidates. Good people often get ignored simply because their resume doesn’t match the exact keywords or format the system is looking for. They’re not rejected for lack of talent — they’re just lost in translation.  That’s when it clicked. With my experience in HR, I know how the backend works. I’ve seen how systems scan resumes, what recruiters look for, and where candidates often go wrong. So I thought — why not turn that insight into something useful for job seekers? Why not build a solution that gives people real feedback, based on how these systems actually work?  That’s how AI Resume Matcher was born. It’s a simple tool that helps job seekers stop guessing and start applying smarter. You just upload your resume, paste the job description (or job link), and get an instant match score. It shows you what you’re missing, what you’ve done right, and exactly how to improve. If you need help fixing it, the AI can even generate improved resume content or a tailored cover letter on the spot.  This isn’t just another resume builder. It’s built from real HR experience, powered by smart AI, and designed to give job seekers the edge they need. Whether you're switching careers, just starting out, or trying to land that dream job — this tool makes the process feel more in your control.  Instead of applying to 50 jobs and hearing nothing, people can now send 10 well-optimized resumes and actually get results. I’ve seen how frustrating job searching can be — and this i",

      "description": "One Moment A Day A beautifully designed mobile journaling app that helps users capture and reflect on meaningful moments from their daily lives.  Inspiration The inspiration for \"One Moment A Day\" came from the desire to create a mindful, intentional journaling experience that encourages users to pause and reflect on the meaningful moments in their daily lives. In our fast-paced world, we often miss the small joys and insights that make life beautiful. This app was born from the belief that taking just one moment each day to reflect can lead to greater self-awareness, gratitude, and personal growth.  The concept emphasizes quality over quantity - rather than overwhelming users with lengthy journaling requirements, it focuses on capturing that one special moment, thought, or feeling that stood out each day. This approach makes journaling accessible and sustainable for people who might feel intimidated by traditional journaling apps.  What it does \"One Moment A Day\" is a beautifully designed mobile journaling app that helps users capture and reflect on meaningful moments from their daily lives. Here's what makes it special:  Core Features: Daily Prompts: Each day presents users with a thoughtful, randomly selected prompt to inspire reflection (e.g., \"What made you smile today?\", \"Describe a moment that surprised you today\") One Entry Per Day: Users can only save one entry per day, encouraging intentional reflection rather than overwhelming journaling. Beautiful UI: Features an aurora-inspired background with smooth animations and a calming color scheme Offline-First: Works seamlessly offline with automatic sync when connection is restored End-to-End Encryption: All journal entries are encrypted using user-specific keys for complete privacy Smart Notifications: Personalized reminder notifications that adapt based on user's streak and behavior Streak Tracking: Motivates users with current and longest streak tracking Search & History: Easy access to past entries with sea",

The platform features three core modules: fully automated email processing that works 24/7 in the background, DatrixAI chatbot for on-demand document processing with user confirmation, and intelligent data analysis that generates charts and insights from plain English queries. What makes Datrix special is its ability to handle the messy, real-world chaos of business documents—from potato-quality scanned PDFs to inconsistently formatted spreadsheets—while providing businesses with clean, actionable data and giving their teams time back to focus on actually growing their business instead of just managing it.",

There’s no built-in feedback when the response is done. That creates micro-frustrations and disrupts focus.  AI Ding fixes this by giving users a simple, customizable audio alert, just like a kitchen timer.

      "description": "## Inspiration The Mind Share was born from a deeply personal struggle. For years, despite a history of academic success, I found myself battling severe memory and concentration problems. These cognitive gaps began to profoundly affect my life, my work, and my ability to learn new things. The breaking point came during my professional career; I failed multiple job interviews due to an inability to recall key details under pressure, and in the rare instances I was hired, my tenure lasted only a few days.  Facing this reality, I decided I had to act. I couldn't find a job that could accommodate my challenges, so I resolved to create my own. My goal was to build the very tool I needed—a solution not just for me, but for anyone else feeling adrift in a sea of mental fog. This project is my answer to that struggle.  ## What it does The Mind Share is a cognitive acceleration platform designed to function as an \"exocortex\"—an external, artificial brain that assists and augments your own. It's built on two core pillars:  Écho - The Real-Time Cognitive Co-Pilot: This is the heart of the application. Écho is a live, conversational AI agent you can \"call\" for instant help. Using technologies like Tavus, it engages in real-time audio and video conversations. It's designed to be multimodal, audio, live video from your camera, and even your screen share to understand your context and provide immediate assistance. Whether you need to remember a detail, focus on a task, or solve a complex problem, Écho is there to bridge the gap.  Collective Intelligence & Community: The platform is designed to facilitate mutual aid.  Shared Knowledge: It anonymously collects and analyzes interaction patterns, reasoning techniques, and prompting strategies from its users. This creates a unique, living knowledge base that the AI draws from, allowing it to provide solutions based on real, effective human intelligence. AI Chat: Users can engage with various AI providers (like Gemini, Mistral, Claude, ",

      "description": "About This Project: Flights Overhead  What Inspired Me  I flew from San Diego to Seattle, then Seattle to Victoria, BC yesterday for a vacation! As I approached each airport, I found myself watching planes take off and land, and wondered: Where are they going? Where did they come from?  That same curiosity often strikes me at home - I live below a flight path and constantly hear aircraft flying overhead. I wanted a tool that could tell me, in real-time, where those planes are headed or returning from. This app is the result of that moment of curiosity.  What I Learned  This was my first time working with both the Mapbox Geocoding API and the FlightAware AeroAPI, and I’m thrilled with how much I’ve expanded my understanding of live geospatial APIs.  I also gained hands-on experience with Supabase Edge Functions, which helped me improve my error handling, environment variable management, and middleware API routing.  How I Built It  The entire application was structured from one comprehensive Bolt prompt that included:  Geolocation and address-based input Mapbox Geocoding to turn addresses into coordinates FlightAware to fetch live nearby flights and calculate the closest one Supabase Edge Function to handle secure API calls React + Tailwind + open-source fonts for a responsive, vintage-style frontend Mobile-first layout with full accessibility, loading states, and error handling Every piece of functionality and design was planned in that initial Bolt prompt. Follow-up prompts were used only for fixing Supabase edge function errors and polishing output. Built With  Bolt (one-prompt workflow) Supabase Mapbox Geocoding API FlightAware AeroAPI React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript Fonts: Share Tech Mono, DM Sans",

I kept thinking, Why isn’t there something that just feels like the real exam? After extensive research I found out that there is no such product out there. So we built it.  What It Does Over a single weekend using bolt.new, we prototyped a TEF Canada prep platform that actually feels like the real thing. It’s a full-scope practice hub powered by AI, covering reading, listening, writing, and speaking—plus real-time feedback and progress tracking that actually helps.  Reading & Listening: Realistic practice in the style and timing of the official exam Writing & Speaking: Instantly evaluated by AI, mapped to CLB levels Progress Dashboard: See what’s working, fix what’s not, and stay motivated with visual milestones How We Built It Bolt-Powered Sprint: We used bolt.new to move fast frontend, backend, and AI evaluation all spun up in one platform Exam Reverse Engineering: We mapped out the TEF structure by breaking down every section type and scoring rubric AI Scoring: LLM handles writing and speaking tasks by evaluating clarity and structure. Challenges We Hit Authenticity Without Infringement: We recreated the TEF vibe without stepping on any official content toes Keeping It Engaging: TEF prep can be dry, so we layered in fun UI and timed challenges to keep things fresh What We’re Proud Of Built a full TEF simulation in a weekend Created CLB-aligned scoring that holds up against certified raters Let learners test drive all four skills without any paywall pressure What We Learned Targeted Practice Wins: Personalized feedback moves the needle faster than one-size-fits-all drills AI + Human = Gold Standard: Even smart models need human oversight to stay sharp Fun > Friction: Progress tracking and gamification make a huge difference in long prep cycles What’s Next Feature to buy credits: People can buy credits.

      "description": "🚀 Vidyaa – Learning Made for the TikTok Generation 🌱 What Inspired Us I’m a Grade 10 student, and I’ve been using Duolingo for over 4 years now. Without any tuition or extra prep, I consistently top my Spanish class, just by casually doing Duolingo every day.  That’s what inspired my dad and me:  \"Why isn’t the rest of school this effortless and fun?\"  We started brainstorming. What followed by days of research and reading on what makes Duolingo click. Chunking, Micro Learning, and Spaced repetitions. What if we took the same bite-sized, gamified learning model and applied it to school subjects, especially ones I and my classmates struggle with? That’s how Vidyaa was born.  It started as a way for me to dogfood my own learning, and has grown into a much larger vision.  🧠 What We Learned Gamified micro-learning works incredibly well, especially for people with short attention spans. (I am the proof.) Students don’t hate studying; they hate boring, one-size-fits-all methods. AI + education = powerful combo. It can personalize, adapt, and accelerate mastery. Building something for yourself first is the best way to make sure it works. 🛠️ How We Built It We started with subjects I study in school, like English, Maths, Physics, etc for IGCSE Class 9 & 10. We broke down chapters into bite-sized lessons, and used AI to generate:  Subjects, Sections and Units with bite-sized courses for learning Smart, spaced quizzes Active recall challenges Personalized learning journeys We used:  React Native for a sleek mobile-first UI Supabase and Node.js backend Perplexity & ChatGPT to generate curriculum-aligned content and auto-grade quiz responses A tutor marketplace for students needing 1:1 help from subject experts Everything was tested and refined using my real class curriculum. I was the first user and critic.  ⚔️ Challenges We Faced Making content engaging and academically rigorous at the same time Building adaptive quizzes that stay relevant as a student progresses Ensuring",

Delayed responses, miscommunication, outdated infrastructure, and the lack of available hospital beds or difficulty finding the right hospital continue to plague emergency systems.  I was inspired by a simple but powerful idea: What if accessing emergency help was as fast and intelligent as ordering a ride? What if I could build a system that actually solves this problem? Rescufast.ai was built to explore that future, where AI bridges the gap between distress and action.",

      "description": "It started with silence. The silence of a father who missed one insulin dose too many. The silence of a grandmother who couldn't recall when her BP shot up. And the crushing silence in dialysis wards — where every patient started with just a few missed signs.  Every 3 out of 5 kidney failures begin with uncontrolled diabetes or blood pressure. Each dialysis patient costs families and health systems up to $60,000/year. But the biggest cost? Time lost, dignity compromised, and decisions delayed.  So we sat with patients. We interviewed doctors. We sifted through handwritten charts, broken apps, and forgotten prescriptions.  They all echoed the same pain:  “I don’t remember what changed last time.”  “Which app was I using again?”  “I missed my follow-up.”  “I forgot when to take my meds.”  That’s when we knew — data wasn’t enough. They didn’t need another tracker. They needed a memory. A guide. A medical companion.  And so, we built KBD Guardian — the AI-powered health guardian that thinks like a doctor and cares like family.  What it does KBD Guardian is a mobile-first, real-time medical web app that tracks and connects all vital signs for kidney patients, diabetics, and those with high blood pressure — while keeping doctors and caregivers always in the loop.",

The idea was inspired by the need for a realistic, self-paced interview practice tool that feels like working with a real interviewer. Designed for anyone looking to improve their interview skills—whether they're students, professionals, or career switchers—InterviewReady offers a video-based mock interview experience using Tavus AI, tailored to the user's resume and job description. Users can choose interview types like HR, Technical, or System Design, and receive smart, AI-powered feedback powered by OpenAI GPT, evaluating their communication, content relevance, and areas for improvement. Built entirely with React.js and deployed using Bolt.new, the platform runs client-side with no backend, making it fast, secure, and easy to deploy.",

      "description": "MockIT was built to solve the repetitive, manual process of creating mockups outside of Figma. I wanted a way to generate polished, realistic 3D device previews without leaving the design environment. MockIT lets you rotate and customize a 3D device, select any Figma layer as the screen, and embed the final render directly into your canvas. It's perfect for designers who want fast, high-quality mockups for portfolios, presentations, or handoffs - all without exporting a single file.",

It provides every user with a personal, on-demand \"Board of Directors\"—a council of specialized AI personas who collaborate to offer multi-faceted guidance. What problem does it solve? We've all been there: stuck at a crossroads with a major life or business decision, wishing we could consult a team of experts—a seasoned executive, an empathetic mentor, an innovative thinker. But this level of advice is inaccessible and expensive. People are left to rely on one-dimensional chatbots or lonely Google searches. Our platform solves this by democratizing high-level advisory. We replace the single, generic AI answer with a dynamic, multi-perspective discussion, ensuring every decision is examined from all critical angles. Who is it for? This is for the ambitious doers: Startup Founders wrestling with strategy, hiring, and pivots. Product Managers seeking diverse input on feature development and roadmaps. Career Changers navigating the uncertainty of a new professional path. Anyone facing a significant life decision who needs a trusted, confidential sounding board. Key Features & Functionality: Our platform is built around a seamless, multi-modal experience designed to replicate and enhance real-world advisory sessions: The Intelligent Orchestrator: This is our core innovation. When a user asks a question, our backend AI (powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash) doesn't just respond. It first analyzes the query's intent and assembles the perfect team of AI advisors from our roster. It then facilitates a real-time group chat where the advisors build on, and even challenge, each other's ideas to provide a comprehensive answer. Live Group Voice Calls: Users can instantly escalate any text chat into a live, interactive group voice call.

The Problem: Most people can't afford an expensive course; even if they can take a course, they often don't know where to start. Not to mention all of the people who are using their skill sets for a job but typically don't have a trusted way of connecting with learners who want to learn.

Administrators: Have a comprehensive overview of the platform, manage users and system-wide stock, utilize advanced AI-driven matchmaking tools, plan logistics (including truck loading and routing), handle billing, and access AI-generated reports and system health dashboards. Features Smart Logistics & Planning: One of its standout features is AI-driven logistics organization. This includes: Matchmaking: AI suggests optimal pairings between customer demands and manufacturer stock.

For so many us, personal safety isn't just about emergencies, it's about just feeling comfortable in our normal, everday lives.

Native Heal is a digital platform built to connect patients with trusted traditional healers in a secure, convenient, and culturally respectful way.  🔍 What Problem Does It Solve? In many African communities, traditional healing is often the first point of care, but the experience is largely offline, fragmented, and built on word-of-mouth referrals. This creates issues like:  Difficulty finding credible healers  Lack of standard booking and communication channels  No visibility into healer expertise or reviews  No digital tools for healers to manage their practice  💡 What Inspired It? As someone deeply rooted in African heritage and passionate about health access, I saw how undervalued and unsupported traditional healers are in the digital world. Many operate informally through Facebook groups or WhatsApp. I wanted to build a trusted, empowering bridge between ancient wisdom and modern tech — honoring our traditions while giving healers tools to thrive.  👥 Who Is It For? Patients who want to safely find and consult with traditional healers.  Healers who want to grow their practice, reach more clients, and manage bookings professionally.  Cultural advocates who care about preserving indigenous knowledge.  🚀 Key Features 🔎 Search & Filter: Find healers by specialisation (e.g., fertility, child health, dream interpretation)  💬 Messaging: Patients and healers can chat securely in-app  📆 Bookings: Patients can request consultations (synchronous or scheduled)  ⭐ Ratings & Reviews: Build credibility through client feedback  🛍️ Healer Shop: Each healer can sell herbal products from their own mini-shop  📚 Healer Blogs & Events: Culturally rich content to engage and educate  🛠️ Admin Tools for Healers: Manage sessions, block off time, track clients  🔗 Google Calendar Sync: Automatically manage healer availability  🛡️ Verification & Approval: Platform verifies healer credentials for patient safety",

      "description": "💡 Problem It Solves / Inspiration: When I started building with Bolt.new, I realized most resources focused on individual features or UI elements — but there was no clear workflow that explained when to use what, or how to chain prompts together for real outcomes.  So, I began documenting my own trial-and-error process. Over time, I refined a system that consistently produced strong Bolt builds using structured prompts, UI feedback loops, and micro-systems.  That became Magic Prompts Workflow — a resource for:  Beginners who want to build real projects faster  Prompt engineers refining their process  Bolt.new users looking to create smarter, not harder  ⚙️ Key Features: Interactive Documentation: Learn by following real-world prompt loops  Progress Tracking: See your learning status as you go  Searchable Prompt Library: Curated prompts for every stage of development  Mobile-First Design: Optimized for usability on any device  Built-in Theme Toggle + Scroll Animations for better UX  🚀 Built Entirely on Bolt.new Modular sections  Scroll-based navigation  Custom layout logic  Progress state with context provider  Clean, responsive design using Framer Motion + Tailwind CSS  Refined using a 6M+ token iterative process  ✨ Actual Prompt Used to Start the Project: “Build a structured documentation website for developers learning to build with Bolt.new. It should guide users from idea to deployment using a prompt-based development workflow. Include a homepage, progress tracker, reusable sections for each topic, and a prompt library that can be filtered. The tone should be modern, helpful, and minimal. Fully responsive, mobile-first, and clean UI.”  🔗 Live Site: https://magicprompts.netlify.app",

      "description": "### **Inspiration**  The inspiration for Pohi AI Pro came directly from real-world experience in the acacia wood pole manufacturing industry. Selling these products globally highlighted significant inefficiencies and a clear need for a centralized system to connect manufacturers with ready stock to customers looking to place orders, and to streamline the complex logistics involved.  ### **What it does**  Pohi AI Pro is a sophisticated database and logistics application designed to revolutionize how manufacturers and their customers interact. At its core, it:  * **Connects Stakeholders:** It serves as a central hub for customers (buyers) to submit their product demands and for manufacturers to list their available stock.   * **Manages Orders & Stock:** The system facilitates the uploading of detailed order requirements by customers and available inventory by manufacturers. A key feature is its AI-powered capability to automatically match these demands with suitable stock.   * **Provides Role-Specific Interfaces:** It offers tailored user interfaces for three distinct roles:     * **Customers:** Can submit new demands (including specialized ones like acacia pole orders) and track their existing demands, benefiting from AI suggestions for alternatives or status explanations.     * **Manufacturers:** Can list new stock items, manage their inventory, and leverage AI tools for price suggestions, marketing text generation, product photo generation, and listing quality analysis.     * **Administrators:** Have a comprehensive overview of the platform, manage users and system-wide stock, utilize advanced AI-driven matchmaking tools, plan logistics (including truck loading and routing), handle billing, and access AI-generated reports and system health dashboards.",

We were inspired by the lack of a place where one could find authentic, quality crafts created by talented local artists. We solve the problem of market \"uniformity\" by offering pieces that have a soul and a story behind them.  2. Who is it for?  Our store is for people who appreciate the value of handmade goods. It's for those who seek unique pieces that tell a story, whether for home decor or for giving a deeply meaningful gift. These are customers who prefer to support small creators and value quality over quantity.  3. Key features, functionality, and integrations  Our e-commerce store stands out for its focus on the story behind each piece. Every product comes with a detailed description of its origin and the artisan who created it. Additionally, we have a secure shipping system and special packaging to protect the items. We use secure payment integrations to ensure a smooth buying experience",

      "description": "Inspiration As a 15-year-old JEE aspirant, my life is built around study schedules, problem sets, and pressure. Everyone around me expects academic excellence, not creative expression. I’ve often heard:  “Coding won’t take you anywhere right now.” “Why waste time on side projects?”  But I’ve always known that I wasn’t built just to follow a syllabus. I wanted to build something that felt like mine.  Late one night, drained after coaching, I opened Bolt.New. No installs, no distractions — just an open canvas and a crazy idea:  What if photo editing could be lightning-fast, powerful like Photoshop, simple like Canva, and all in the browser?  That’s how ADIFI was born. Not just a tool, but my rebellion against rote learning and my belief that I can create something real — even when no one believes in me.  What it does Adifi(AKA photo studio pro) is a lightning-fast, privacy-first photo editor that works completely in-browser. It combines the precision of Photoshop with the simplicity of Canva, without requiring any downloads or uploads.  Features:  Multi-layer editing (images, text, effects)  Real-time filters (brightness, contrast, blur, vignette, etc.)  AI-powered background removal (using BodyPix)  Instant exports (with zero server processing)  Fully responsive UI with keyboard shortcuts and live previews  How we built it Built entirely in Bolt.New using vibe coding — described my vision and let AI scaffold the architecture.  Used React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS for structure and styling.  Built a custom Canvas engine to handle layers, effects, and pixel manipulations.  Integrated TensorFlow.js and BodyPix for client-side AI features like background removal.  Added undo/redo functionality, image state tracking, and real-time performance stats.  Challenges we ran into Balancing studies and coding: Working on ADIFI late at night, after long coaching days, was emotionally and mentally draining.  Performance bottlenecks: Large image processing would slow the browse",

As a part-time online language tutor with over 50 students monthly, I experienced firsthand the immense burden of lesson preparation. Understanding each student's unique needs, crafting personalized lesson plans, and then tailoring interactive materials for every single session became more time-consuming than the actual teaching. This problem isn't isolated; it's a struggle shared by over a million private one-on-one language tutors globally who are often overlooked by giant platforms like Preply and Italki, which primarily focus on learners. I realized there was a massive market gap: a need for a tool that empowers tutors, reduces their administrative load, and allows them to scale their impact without sacrificing personalization. LinguaFlow was born from this necessity – to transform hours of tedious work into seconds of intelligent creation, keeping the human touch at its core.",

Bickqr helps you share audio memes.

Traditional tools rely on keyword matching, job titles, or rigid templates that reduce a person’s journey to a set of checkboxes. This leaves out those who’ve switched paths, taken breaks, worked across sectors, or grown in unconventional ways.  💡Skillo tackles this with empathy and intelligence.💡 Skillo performs a full-scale career analysis, tracing your professional arc, recognizing your growth, and interpreting the choices and pivots that shaped your journey. It draws inferences, understands patterns, surfaces overlooked skills, and offers thoughtful, practical next steps. It shows people what roles they fit into, where their gaps are, and what options they might not have considered — including alternate roles that are realistic and reachable.  In doing so, it supports not just job seekers, but people in transition — from employed to unemployed, from stuck to searching, from uncertain to clear.  💡 Innovation💡 Skillo improves on existing solutions by going beyond surface-level keyword scanning. Most resume tools offer optimization based on what an algorithm or ATS might want.

I once had a brief interaction with a girl. We smiled at each other. I saw her again on a beach, but I wasn’t confident enough to approach her. I didn’t know her name, who her friends were, or where she studied. It was a huge city, and I knew the chances of ever seeing her again were slim unless destiny had something planned. But I wasn’t that lucky. I never saw her again.  Even now, that moment stays with me. I often wonder how two strangers who felt something could they ever find each other again. If they don’t know names, addresses, or any personal details. That question stayed with me and eventually sparked the idea for this project.  YouLookedAt.me is a platform where you can share your missed connection moment. If someone else posts a story that matches yours, you’ll be notified and can start a chat. It’s a space to share real, heartfelt stories, post anonymous notes, and maybe even reconnect with someone you briefly crossed paths with.

By the end of each week my pockets are stuffed with business cards and my LinkedIn inbox is full of “nice to meet you” messages, but when a real problem surfaces I cannot remember which of those contacts actually fits the challenge. I wanted a tool that would treat every introduction as data, tie it to my business goals, and surface the one expert or company that can move the needle right now. Tagramp began as that personal itch: turning random networking into a goal-centric, ROI-driven engine for growth and collaboration. What it does Tagramp is an AI-first SaaS platform that converts static contact lists into living, goal-oriented opportunities.  AI profile generation I paste a website URL, PDF deck, or plain text. Natural-language models summarise the material and create a concise company or personal profile plus a short list of top-level goals.  Goal-centric matching Those goals feed an intelligent matcher that scans verified professionals and organisations—either public communities or networks I import. The algorithm scores each potential connection on relevance, complementary expertise, and past success.  Instant collaboration framework When a match is found the system produces a “Ramp-a-Plan,” an editable roadmap and a ready-to-send introduction email. Instead of starting from “let’s grab coffee,” both sides see clear next steps and mutual value from day one.  Monetisable networks As a community owner I can charge subscription fees so only vetted members appear in match results, which preserves quality and creates a revenue stream.  Built-in relationship tracking A light CRM layer records email threads, Slack or WhatsApp chats, calendar events, and call notes so progress is measurable from first hello to closed deal.  Free users can browse and search manually, but AI-powered actions unlock with a five-dollar personal plan or a twenty-",

As a freelancer, I often juggle multiple clients and projects, and I’ve personally struggled with time management, scheduling, sending updates on time, and just keeping track of what needs to be done.  I wanted to build something that lets people offload that mental load using simple voice or chat interaction. That's where TaskVoice AI was born a smart productivity assistant that lets you create tasks using AI chat, AI voice, or manual input, however you prefer to work.  I was inspired by the way people talk to assistants like Siri or ChatGPT, but I wanted to give that power a focused purpose: getting things done fast and frictionlessly.  TaskVoice AI is a smart productivity assistant that helps users create and manage tasks using three input modes:  Voice AI — Speak your tasks naturally, and it understands and schedules them.

Ecclisio is a modern tool designed to serve the entire church—from first-time volunteers to experienced pastors. Its name is a modernized nod to Ekklesia, the Greek word for “church.”  Technology should empower ministry, not hinder it. It’s time the Church caught up. Welcome to Ecclisio.",

      "description": "What problem does it solve, or what inspired you to build it?  TrafficIQ solves the deadly crisis of unpredictable traffic congestion that costs lives, time, and trillions globally. I was inspired to build it after personally falling asleep in Lagos traffic and witnessing a patient die in an ambulance during the catastrophic Independence Bridge gridlock where people were trapped for 48+ hours - I realized we can predict weather and stock markets but people still drive blind into traffic disasters that kill and cost the global economy over $1 trillion annually.  Who is it for?  TrafficIQ is for daily commuters losing hours to traffic (like Lagos residents who lose 2 months yearly), emergency services needing life-saving priority routing, city governments requiring smart traffic management, logistics companies optimizing deliveries, and anyone who believes no one should die in traffic because we couldn't predict the predictable.  Key features, functionality, or integrations:  TrafficIQ provides 24-hour traffic predictions (world's first), emergency vehicle priority routing with dynamic corridors, AI-powered congestion hotspot identification, real-time alternative routes, and city-wide impact tracking that reduces commute times by 30-40%, built with Bolt.new for rapid development, Together AI for prediction algorithms, Supabase for real-time data, Google Maps API for traffic data, and deployed on Netlify - achieving 85% prediction accuracy and proving its worth by saving my 2-hour commute this morning!",

Without a proper system, it's easy to lose sight of who's in, who's out, and who might be missing – and that lack of oversight can be critical.  Just two weeks ago, I discovered Bolt, a powerful no-code platform. I had never built anything with it before, but I decided to take on the challenge and create a real solution. I was honestly amazed at how intuitive and smart Bolt was – sometimes it even understood my needs better than I could explain them!  I learned a lot during the process: new development terms, UI/UX logic, how to build live dashboards, manage user roles, create smart alerts, and set up powerful automations and external integrations. I published the app using Netlify, and although I tried to connect a personal domain via ENTRI, I ran into technical issues – which became a valuable part of the learning journey.  Now, I'm proud not only of the app, but of the entire process – turning a real need into a smart, automated solution that supports staff, protects students, and opens the door to even more innovation ahead.",

The Problem: Women face a brutal reality - altering routes, avoiding streets, living in constant fear. Traditional solutions fail: police take 15+ minutes, emergency apps are cold and impersonal, self-defense isn't accessible to all. The Solution: A 2-3 minute human intervention system that transforms every caring person into a Guardian Angel. When a woman feels threatened, nearby verified community members receive alerts and can approach naturally, pretending to know her to deter aggressors. Key Features:  Ultra-realistic fake calls with hidden emergency functions in call interface buttons Smart community alerts with precise geolocation and photo identification Anti-coercion protection via secure PIN codes preventing forced cancellation International emergency system with pre-recorded messages in 6 languages Advanced privacy protection against potential infiltrated aggressors  Target Users: Women seeking safety, community members wanting to help, and organizations focused on women's protection across 11 supported countries. Built with Bolt.new in a single development sprint, showcasing AI-powered rapid prototyping for social impact. The app demonstrates how technology can restore what humanity treasures most: community solidarity transforming isolation into safety.",

PurpleVerse was inspired by the frustrating limitations people in low-income countries face when shopping online — especially when it comes to international payments, FOREX instability, and platform restrictions. Traditional e-commerce is often inaccessible or expensive for users in these regions, and that creates a digital divide in global trade.  I wanted to solve this by creating a borderless e-commerce platform that leverages crypto (USDC on Algorand Testnet for the prototype) as the means of payment. This removes the need for traditional financial systems and enables secure, trustless transactions worldwide — even for physical goods.  PurpleVerse is for:  Buyers who want to shop globally without payment restrictions.  Sellers looking to reach wider markets and access intelligent tools.  Emerging markets underserved by mainstream payment systems.   🔑 Key Features & Functionality  Crypto-Powered Payments Secure, escrow-based crypto transactions using USDC on Algorand. Funds are held until buyers confirm delivery.  Mock Wallet Integration For demo purposes, a hardcoded mock wallet simulates crypto payments and release flows.  AI-Assisted Seller Tools Sellers get help writing product descriptions, tracking analytics, and managing inventory through AI-powered features.  Admin Dashboard Full control panel to manage users, roles, featured products, commissions, and blog content.  Flash Sales & Featured Listings Sellers can run time-limited offers or pay to boost product visibility across the platform.  Platform Revenue Model 5% commission on every sale + featured product placement fees, all automated.  Blog and AI Chatbot (Support) Includes a built-in blog CMS and AI chatbot to assist buyers and sellers with FAQs and navigation.   🔌 Built With:  Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vite  Backend: Supabase (auth, DB, storage, functions, RLS)  Blockchain: Algorand (Testnet) using algo",

The core problem it aims to solve is providing an intelligent, secure, and user-friendly conversational AI experience, moving beyond basic chatbots to offer deeper knowledge and assistance. It's built to showcase the potential of integrating powerful AI models with robust, modern web technologies.  This project is primarily for users seeking an intelligent conversational partner for various inquiries, from technology and science to general assistance. It's also a valuable resource for developers and AI enthusiasts interested in how a full-stack AI application can be built with a focus on security, performance, and user experience.  Here are some of its key features, functionalities, and integrations:  Advanced AI Integration: At its heart, renat.ai integrates with the OpenAI API to provide sophisticated chat capabilities, allowing it to understand and respond to complex queries. Secure Authentication and Database: It uses Supabase for robust user authentication and as its PostgreSQL database, ensuring secure user management and persistent storage of chat messages. Comprehensive Security Measures: Security is a paramount concern, with features like: Content Security Policy (CSP) configured in netlify.toml to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Input Validation and Rate Limiting (src/lib/security.ts) to protect against abuse and ensure data integrity. Secure Headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection) for enhanced browser security. Secure Logging (src/lib/logger.ts) for monitoring security events and authentication attempts. Modern Frontend Development: The application is built with React and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and visually appealing interface, and uses Lucide React for a consistent icon set.

What it does Doodibook is a magical web application that transforms children’s drawings into enchanting stories and illustrations.

We have Instagram for photos, YouTube for videos, Twitter for text, GIPHY for GIFs, and now Bickqr is here for short audio memes.Think of it as the GIPHY for audio. Bickqr helps you share audio memes.

      "description": "What Inspired Me I flew from San Diego to Seattle, then Seattle to Victoria, BC yesterday for a vacation! As I approached each airport, I found myself watching planes take off and land, and wondered: Where are they going? Where did they come from?  That same curiosity often strikes me at home - I live below a flight path and constantly hear aircraft flying overhead. I wanted a tool that could tell me, in real-time, where those planes are headed or returning from. This app is the result of that moment of curiosity.  What I Learned This was my first time working with both the Mapbox Geocoding API and the FlightAware AeroAPI, and I’m thrilled with how much I’ve expanded my understanding of live geospatial APIs.  I also gained hands-on experience with Supabase Edge Functions, which helped me improve my error handling, environment variable management, and middleware API routing.  How I Built It The entire application was structured from one comprehensive Bolt prompt that included:  Geolocation and address-based input Mapbox Geocoding to turn addresses into coordinates FlightAware to fetch live nearby flights and calculate the closest one Supabase Edge Function to handle secure API calls React + Tailwind + open-source fonts for a responsive, vintage-style frontend Mobile-first layout with full accessibility, loading states, and error handling Every piece of functionality and design was planned in that initial Bolt prompt. Follow-up prompts were used only for fixing Supabase edge function errors and polishing output.",

Unlike regular scheduling apps, Day-2-Day integrates your full schedule with your personal life. You don't just have a list of to-dos; what you have is a personalized priority schedule. A few key features 👉  👉 For new users, Day-2-Day begins with an interactive and easy onboarding process where you’ll smoothly enter preset activities — including usual daily activities (like breakfast and brushing), preset schedules (like school or work), hobbies, habits you're building, and personal projects you’re working on, etc — all through a simple, selectable and adjustable interface. Just quick taps or edits to input frequencies, durations, commute, and as much detail as possible. Yes! Your assistant takes these details into consideration when helping you plan for the day.  📝 As life goes on, add new to-dos for the current day or days ahead.  📅 Hit the “Generate Smart Schedule” button, and your assistant creates a suggested plan for the day, based on preset activities (or recurring tasks) and specific to-dos. You can move, edit, delete, and add blocks (activities on your schedule) to suit you.  ⚡ On the move? The Quick Add feature lets you drop in tasks without slowing down.  📈 Track your progress with: ✅ A habit tracker (see streaks and completion), 🎯 Task progress over time, 🌤 Daily mood check-ins, and more.

From drag-and-drop lineups to automatic substitution schedules and real-time playtime tracking, it simplifies match-day management. Stay focused on the game—doHockey handles the logistics.  ##Why doHockey? As an amateur field hockey coach, I know how much time and effort goes into managing a team — especially on busy weekends. Planning lineups, tracking playtime, and organizing substitutions often takes more time than the match itself. That’s why I developed doHockey: a practical, time-saving tool designed to take the hassle out of match-day management.  doHockey helps coaches stay focused on the game by handling the logistics. You can easily create lineups with a drag-and-drop interface, automatically generate substitution schedules based on preset intervals, and track each player’s playtime in real time. Whether you want to rotate players every 6 or 9 minutes, or ensure fair playing time for everyone, doHockey makes it simple.  The tool supports standard match settings — four quarters of 17.5 minutes, with up to five reserves — and provides a live dashboard during the match, along with a printable substitution schedule to keep things running smoothly on the sidelines.  doHockey is built for coaches like me, who love the sport but could use a bit of help staying organized. It saves time, reduces stress, and ensures every player gets the attention they deserve.  Inspiration  As an amateur field hockey coach, I often spend more time planning than coaching. Organizing lineups, substitutions, and tracking playtime — especially during weekend matches — can be stressful and inefficient. I wanted a tool to take care of the logistics so I could focus on the team and the game.",
